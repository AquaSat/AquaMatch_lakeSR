The Landsat archive of multispectral and thermal data in lakeSR is composed of Landsat missions 4 through 9 and spans more than 40 years. Mission Launch Date End of Science Mission Decommission Date Landsat 4 TM 1982-07-16 1993-12-14 2001-06-15 Landsat 5 TM 1984-03-01 2011-11-18 2013-06-05 Landsat 7 E TM+ 1999-04-15 2022-04-06 Landsat 8 OLI/T IRS 2013-02-11 Landsat 9 OLI-2/TIR S-2 2021-09-27 The image record for Landsat 4 is not consistent nor robust due to a data transmitter failure early in service. Landsat 6 did not achieve orbit. 4.1.1 Spectral Response While the nominal bands for each of the missions within the archive is relatively consistent (with the addition of an Aerosol band beginning Landsat 8), the precise spectral response for each nominal band shifted beginning with Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS: S ensors Ae rosol Blue Green Red Near Inf rared (NIR) Short Wave Inf rared 1 (SWIR 1) Short Wave Inf rared 2 (SWIR 2) Th ermal TM ETM+ N/A 0.45 -0.52 μm 0.52 -0.60 μm 0.63 -0.69 μm 0.77 -0.90 μm 1.55 -1.75 μm 2.08 -2.35 μm 1 0.40- 12.50 μm OL I/TIRS OLI-2/ TIRS-2 0 .435- 0.451 μm 0 .452- 0.512 μm 0 .533- 0.590 μm 0 .636- 0.673 μm 0 .851- 0.879 μm 1 .566- 1.651 μm 2 .107- 2.294 μm 10 .60-1 1.19, 1 1.50- 12.51 μm 4.1.2 Sensor Resolution The spatial resolution of the Level 1 data has not changed for optical bands (Aerosol, RGB, NIR, SWIR) but has varied over the history for thermal data: Sensors Optical Bands Thermal Bands TM 30 120 ETM+ 30 60 OLI/TIRS OLI-2/TIRS-2 30 100 All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have been resampled to 30m. Alongside the pixel resolution of the sensors is the radiometric resolution at which the data are stored. TM and ETM+ data are stored as 8-bit data products, OLI data are quantitized to 12 bits and Landsat 9 to 14 bits. This equates to 256 shades per band for Landsat 4-7, 4,096 shades for Landsat 8 and 16,384 shades for Landsat 9, where higher numbers allow for greater precision of measurement in a given band. All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have been rescaled to 16 bits. 4.2 Surface Reflectance Product The information presented in this section originates from the USGS Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR. The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance (SR) product is a Level 2 data product that has been atmospherically corrected from the Level 1 Top of Atmosphere product using a myriad of inputs to create a reasonably consistent data product across space and time. The USGS EROS describes the SR product as follows: Surface reflectance improves comparison between multiple images over the same region by accounting for atmospheric effects such as aerosol scattering and thin clouds, which can help in the detection and characterization of Earth surface change. Surface reflectance is generated from Level-1 inputs that meet the &lt;76 degrees Solar Zenith Angle constraint and include the required auxiliary data inputs to generate a scientifically viable product. 4.2.1 Atmospheric Processing The SR product for Landsat 4-7 is calculated using the Land Ecosystem Distrubance Adaptive Procesing System (LEDAPS) (Schmidt et al. 2013) and Landsat 8 and 9 SR data are calculated using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) algorithm (Vermote et al. 2018). The two algorithms are functionally different, but the outcome is the same: a consistently-processed surface reflectance product that is available worldwide. See the table under section heading ‘Differences in Surface Reflectance Processing Algorithms’ on the USGS Landsat C2 website for details. 4.3 Surface Temperature The information presented in this section originates from the USGS Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR. The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature product is calculated using a single-channel algorithm using auxiliary atmospheric data sources (M. J. Cook 2014; M. Cook et al. 2014).
