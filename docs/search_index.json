Specifically, this document describes data for all lakes greater than 1 hectare in the United States and US Territories (“lakeSR”) and sites associated with Water Quality Portal (“WQP”) data harmonized within the AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP data product (“siteSR_WQP”). We include the suffix “WQP” for siteSR to indicate the data originate from the WQP, allowing for future development of in situ data that may come from other sources. Generally speaking, siteSR refers to remote sensing data acquired at locations with in situ data and lakeSR refers to remote sensing data acquired at centrally-located points of waterbodies. Further, within this document “siteSR” refers the general workflow for acquiring remote sensing data at a location with sampling data and “siteSR_WQP” when there are steps that are specific to the WQP-derived locations. AquaSat v2 represents modular code and data infrastructure for: harmonizing in situ data from the Water Quality Portal and providing an interoperability tiering structure to allow for easier downstream filtering (“AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP”) acquiring remote sensing data of inland waterbodies and rivers (lakeSR, siteSR, and riverSR) pairing in situ data and remote sensing data for parameter-specific algorithm development (e.g., AquaMatch_WQP_LandsatC2) The goal of these data products is to facilitate assessment and monitoring of waterbodies within the United States and Territories using both in situ and remote sensing data. AquaSat v2 builds upon AquaSat (Ross et al. 2019) (referred to here as “AquaSat v1”) and LimnoSat-US (Topp et al. 2020). AquaSat v1 focused on pairing remote sensing data with in situ observations and measurements while LimnoSat-US acquired remote sensing for all waterbodies greater than 10 hectares across the Continental United States (CONUS) regardless of whether in situ measurements were available for that waterbody. In AquaSat v2, we bring these products together. For instance, lakeSR can define Landsat intermission handoffs to enable use of Landsat as a timeseries product, siteSR products can be used to create parameter-specific algorithms, and those algorithms can be applied to lakeSR to create a timeseries of water quality for waterbodies in the US and territories. AquaSat v2 code is built on the {targets} workflow management system for R (Landau 2021). The {targets} architecture is based on lists of functions performed in a specific order, each function called a target. The primary benefit of {targets} workflows is that code is only run if a target, a target’s code, or a target’s dependencies have changed (or become “outdated” in {targets} speak). 1.1 Note Images used in analyses courtesy of the United States Geological Survey.

"],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 lakeSR Code Architecture 2.2 siteSR_WQP Code Architecture", " 2 Background Currently, AquaSat v2 remote sensing products contain data from the historical Landsat Collection 2 record from 1984 until late 2024, including the following missions: Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM) Landsat 5 TM Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS There will be additional satellite data incorporated into AquaSat v2 in the future. 2.1 lakeSR Code Architecture lakeSR code is broken down into groups of targets that perform specific tasks, listed below with a brief summary about what task(s) each group completes. This particular workflow incorporates both R and Python programming languages to complete these tasks. 2.1.1 Configuration Files config.yml: lakeSR relies on this configuration file to run specific profiles that determine what operations are being run. The file contains two configuration profiles: “default” and “admin_update”. “default” uses publicly-posted stable versions of datasets from AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP and is intended for those who wish to modify choices made after Landsat stacks are acquired (e.g. baseline quality assurance filters {targets} group -d- and calculation of handoff coefficients group -e-). By default, the bookdown is not rendered in this option, as changes to the pipeline may require non-automated changes to the text of the bookdown. “admin_update” is intended for use by ROSSyndicate members when updating siteSR datasets and create publicly-stable versions of the siteSR_WQP to be stored in the AquaMatch_siteSR_WQP repository. This configuration could also be used by others to re-run the pipeline and wish to make changes to the site location calculations ({targets} group -a-) or GEE implementation ({targets} group -b-) and collation ({targets} group -c-). By default, the bookdown is rendered in this option, but keep in mind not all changes implemented are not automatically reflected in the bookdown. Advanced users are welcome to adapt the pipeline to incorporate other masks or filters or to incorporate other quality assurance filters or handoff methods. Note: the Landsat Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature products should not be used without applying a handoff coefficient to harmonize data between missions if you are using data from multiple Landsat missions. See Section 8 for details on this process. Proper configuration of harmonize_repo_directory is imperative as the siteSR_WQP workflow references files inside AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP file structure. If this is incorrectly set up, users will receive a message to communicate this. All repositories stored on the AquaSat v2 GitHub will contain files that link to versions of the data that the AquaSat v2 team has harmonized so that a local run is not necessitated. If the configuration setting for update_bookdown is set as TRUE, configuration of siteSR_repo_directory is also required, as the bookdown pulls information from siteSR to render. gee_config.yml: This configuration file defines parameters of the GEE pull. This configuration can be customized. To create a different configuration of the GEE pull, fill out the yaml file at the file path b_pull_Landast_SRST_poi/gee_config.yml. If you change the name of this file, you will need to update the file name at line 32 of the _targets.R file. 2.1.2 {targets} groups a_Calculate_Centers: This {targets} list calculates “Pole of Inaccessibility” (POI) (Garcia-Castellanos and Lombardo 2007) for all non-intermittent lakes, ponds, and reservoirs greater than 1 hectare in surface area and intermittent lakes, ponds, and reservoirs greater than 4 hectares using the NHDPlusV2 polygons using the {nhdplusTools} package (Blodgett and Johnson 2023), NHD Best Resolution files for non-CONUS waterbodies, and the poi() function in the {polylabelr} package (Larsson 2020). See Section 3 for additional background and detailed methodology. This group is either run completely or pulled from exisiting files based on lakeSR general configuration file using the boolean calculate_centers setting. If set to FALSE a version date must be provided in the centers_version setting. Additional guidance is provided in the README and general configuration file of the lakeSR repository. b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi: This {targets} group uses the configuration file b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config_poi.yml and the “Pole of Inaccessibility” points created in the a_Calculate_Centers group to pull Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) API. In this group, we use the most conservative LS4-7 pixel filters, as we are applying these settings across such a large continuum of time and space. This group ends with a branched target that sends tasks to Google Earth engine by mapping over WRS2 path rows that intersect with the points created in the a_Calculate_Centers group. Note: this group of targets takes a very long time, running 2 minutes - 1 hour per path-row branch in b_eeRun_poi. There are just under 800 path rows executed in this target. Anecdotally speaking, processing time is often defined by the number of queued tasks globally, so weekends and nights are often periods of quicker processing than weekday during business hours. As written for data publication, run time is 7-10 days. See Section 4 for details on software used in this workflow, Section 5 for additional background on Landsat data, and Section 6 for detailed methodology of the Landsat pull. This group is either run completely or pulled from exisiting files based on lakeSR general configuration file using the boolean run_GEE setting. If set to FALSE a version date must be provided in the collated_version setting. Additional guidance is provided in the README and general configuration file of the lakeSR repository. c_collate_Landsat_data: This {targets} list collates the data from the Google Earth Engine run orchestrated in the {targets} group b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi and creates publicly-available files for downstream use, storing a dataframe of Drive ids in a .csv in the c_collate_Landsat_data/out/ folder. This group is either run completely or pulled from exisiting files based on lakeSR general configuration file using the boolean run_GEE setting. If set to FALSE a version date must be provided in the collated_version setting. Additional guidance is provided in the README and general configuration file of the lakeSR repository. d_qa_filter_sort: This {targets} list applies some rudimentary QA to the Landsat stacks and saves them as sorted files locally. LS 4/9 are complete .csv files, LS 578 are broken up by HUC2 for memory and space considerations. If update_and_share is set to TRUE, the workflow will send dated, publicly available files to Google Drive and save Drive file information in the d_qa_filter_sort/out/ folder. If set to FALSE, no files will be sent to Drive. See Section 7 for detailed methodology of this portion of the workflow. e_caclculate_handoffs: This {targets} group creates “matched” data for two different ‘intermission handoff’ methods that standardize the SR values relative to LS7 and to LS8. Handoffs are visualized and are saved as tables for use downstream in this group. Corrections are calculated for all neighboring missions, even if not explicitly used downstream (e.g. LS 4/5 and LS 8/9). See Section 8 for detailed methodology of this portion of the workflow. y_siteSR_targets: This {targets} group pulls information from the siteSR workflow to use in the Bookdown. If the configuration setting update_bookown is set to FALSE, this list will be empty. z_render_bookdown: This {targets} group tracks chapters of the bookdown for changes and renders the bookdown. If the configuration setting update_bookown is set to FALSE, this list will be empty. 2.2 siteSR_WQP Code Architecture siteSR_WQP code is built upon the output of AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP. AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP provides harmonized in situ data from the Water Quality Portal for pairing remote sensing data acquired at the sites of in situ data collection with in situ measurements. This workflow picks up where AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP ends, retrieving the WQP sites at which there are historical in situ data. lakeSR provides calculated Landsat intermission handoff coefficients for interoperability between sensors (see Section 8). In order to run the siteSR_WQP workflow, you must have a cloned version of AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP codebase on your local computer. Section 2.2.1 covers details about this requirement. 2.2.1 Configuration Files config.yml: siteSR_WQP relies on this configuration file to run specific profiles that determine what operations are being run. The file provides two configuration profiles: “default” and “admin_update”. “default” runs the pipeline using archived versions of datasets made with specific {targets} groups within this workflow. In this setting, {targets} groups -4- (collating locations from WQP), -5- (determining remote sensing visibility), and -6- (pulling the Landsat record from GEE) are not run, but rather archived files are pulled in to reduce run time. “admin_update” is intended for use by ROSSyndicate members when updating siteSR datasets and create publicly-stable versions of the siteSR_WQP to be stored in the AquaMatch_siteSR_WQP repository. This configuration could also be used by others to re-run the pipeline and wish to make changes to the site location collation ({targets} group -4-), remote sensing visibility thresholds ({targets} group -5-) or GEE implementation ({targets} group -6-). Note: The Landsat Surface Reflectance product should not be used without applying a handoff coefficient if you are using data from multiple Landsat missions. See Section 8 for details on this process. Proper configuration of harmonize_repo_directory is imperative as the siteSR_WQP workflow references files inside AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP file structure. If this is incorrectly set up, users will receive a message to communicate this. All repositories stored on the AquaSat v2 GitHub will contain files that link to versions of the data that the AquaSat v2 team has harmonized so that a local run is not necessitated. gee_config.yml: This configuration file defines parameters of the GEE pull. This configuration can be customized. To create a different configuration of the GEE pull, fill out the yaml file at the file path gee_config.yml. If you change the name of this file, you will need to update the file name at line 9 of the 5_determine_RS_visibility.R script. 2.2.2 {targets} Groups _targets.R: This initial group of targets checks the configuration settings in config.yml, checks for the harmonization and lakeSR pipelines, and checks for Google Drive folder architecture. This group also acquires target objects from the harmonization and lakeSR pipelines. 4_compile_sites: This {targets} group collates the sites from the harmonization pipeline, creating a list of locations to acquire remote sensing data. All locations are associated with a HUC8 if one is not listed in the metadata for the site from the WQP, then the unique HUC4s are used to associate points with waterbodies and flowlines of the NHDPlusV2 (CONUS) or NHD Best Resolution (non-CONUS HUCs) files. 5_determine_RS_visibility: The resulting list of in situ locations are used to assess remote-sensing visibility in this {targets} group. Sites are assessed for visibility using the JRC Global Surface Water (Pekel et al. 2016) which is based on the historical Landsat record. This {targets} group takes a number of hours to run, if the configuration of run_pekel is set to TRUE. If the configuration is set to FALSE, run time will be dependent on your internet connection (to access the previously-created files) and the number of cores available to run the workflow. 6_siteSR_stack: This group of {targets} acquires Landsat Collection 2 SRST stacks for sites determined to be visible in the previous {targets} group. Data are collated in this step. This {targets} group takes about three days to run, if the configuration run_GEE is set to TRUE. If the configuration is set to FALSE, run time will be dependent on your internet connection (to access the previously-created files) and the number of cores available to run the workflow. 7_siteSR_qa: Collated Landsat data are filtered for quality based on broadly applicable thresholds and exported from the pipeline for data archiving.

"],["locs-data-acq.html", "3 Locations of Data Acquisition 3.1 Waterbodies Included in lakeSR 3.2 siteSR_WQP Acquisition Locations", " 3 Locations of Data Acquisition As noted in the Introduction (Section 1), for the purposes of AquaSat v2, surface reflectance and surface temperature data are acquired at specific, centrally-located points within waterbodies (typically in pelagic locations of lakes, lakeSR) and at locations where there are in situ data (siteSR). The data acquired at locations where there are in situ data are meant to create location-specific algorithms using the AquaMatch database, which can then be applied to the data collected over the centrally-located point across all waterbodies in the lakeSR database. lakeSR does not acquire nor summarize data over the entire waterbody’s surface, as it is computationally impractical for most large lakes, especially those that cross multiple satellite path-rows or tiles. For the lakeSR product, we summarize the Landsat data within a 120 meter radius of a defined location. For siteSR, we use a 200 meter buffer. 3.1 Waterbodies Included in lakeSR For lakeSR, we use the NHDPlusV2 dataset for lakes within the conterminous US and US Territories using the {nhdplusTools} R package (Blodgett and Johnson 2023) and the NHD Best Resolution (e.g. US Geological Survey 2023b) data through The National Map. All waterbody polygons were downloaded and processed in 2025-02-12 by HUC4 using the most updated version available at the time of download. Figure 3.1: NHD HUC4 map for the United States and Territories, courtesy of the USGS. For every HUC4 in the United States and Territories (Figure 3.1), all waterbodies are limited to those with NHD Waterbody Subtypes belonging to the following groups: 390 (lake/pond) and 436 (reservoir) and are at least 0.01 km2 (1 hectare) in area according to the area value provided in the NHD file. If the feature type (FType) of the waterbody belonged to an intermittent category (39001, 39005, 39006, 43614) the threshold for inclusion was increased to 0.04 km2 (4 hectares) to reduce processing time when extracting data from Google Earth Engine. This filtering resulted in 729,941 waterbodies included in our dataset, including 313,248 non-CONUS waterbodies. This is a 1,185 percent increase over the 56,792 lakes included in the original AquaSat product. For each waterbody, the Pole of Inaccessibility (see Section 3.1.2) and distance-to-shore radius was calculated using the polylabelr::poi() function. It is important to note that the poi() function can sometimes attribute a POI to a location other than the point furthest away from a shoreline. This occurs in polygons with a very large number of indices (due to sheer area or geomorphological complexity); however the points calculated should be an acceptable proxy for pelagic lake conditions. 3.1.1 Updates in AquaSat v2 Some changes in lake polygon and center point have been made in modernizing and scaling from LimnoSat-US. The lake center aspect called “deepest point” of LimnoSat-US was built upon HydroLakes (Messager et al. 2016), a global database of lakes greater than 10 hectares accounting for 1.4 million waterbodies and a total surface area of 2.67 million km² worldwide. While this dataset of lakes represents ~55% of the worldwide surface area of lakes greater than 1 hectare, it is only a sliver of the estimated 27 million waterbodies in the world (Verpoorter et al. 2014). AquaSat v2 uses the USGS’s National Hydrography products which map the surface waters of the United States, and allows for reduction in minimum size of waterbody and an increase in coverage of freshwater systems across the United States and permanently inhabited territories. 3.1.2 Pole of Inaccessibility The USGS National Hydrography products contain smaller and higher resolution polygons than the HydroLakes shapes, which makes it computationally impossible to use the Chebyshev Center (“deepest point,” Yang 2020) calculation used in LimnoSat-US due to the number of vertices in each polygon. To replace this important step in the update, we employ the concept of “pole of inaccessibility” (POI, Stefansson 1920). The concept of POI is used to define the geographic center of a circle with the largest circumference within any complex polygon. The foundational principle is used widely to describe the arctic pole of inaccessiblity, that is the point in the northern arctic circle that is the furthest from land, but has also been used to describe the geographic center of landmasses (Garcia-Castellanos and Lombardo 2007). For lakeSR, we use POI to determine the point in a waterbody that is furthest from the shoreline using the polylabelr::poi() function (Larsson 2020), which calculates a point in space and the radius of the circle used to define the POI. 3.1.3 Technical Implementation of lakeSR The code for gathering NHD waterbodies and calculating their respective POIs is found in {targets} group a_Calculate_Centers which is located in the script a_Calculate_Centers.R at the root directory of the repository. The processing begins by acquiring the polygons of all US states and territories using the {tigris} package (Walker 2023). These polygons are used to acquire a list HUC4s that intersect with each municipal boundary using the nhdplusTools::get_huc() function, which are then reduced to distinct HUC4’s and transformed into a vector of HUC4s. HUC4s are then split into CONUS (HUC4 &lt; 1900) and non-CONUS (HUC4 ≥ 1900) groups. To efficiently calculate the POI across hundreds of HUC4s, we use the dynamic branching feature to iterate over each HUC4. For each HUC4, the NHDPlusV2 (CONUS) or NHD Best Resolution (non CONUS) waterbodies are acquired and filtered for lake/ponds and reservoirs of at least 1 hectare in area or 4 hectares for intermittent lake/ponds or reservoirs. In order to accurately calculate distance-to-shore when using the polylabelr::poi() function as described in Section 3.1, each waterbody was converted to the proper Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection calculated from the mean longitudinal value of the polygon vertices prior to applying the poi() function. By using the point-local UTM projection, we decrease distortion expected from any single CRS used to represent all of the locations from which we have lakes. The latitude and longitude values of the POI were transformed to decimal degrees in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84, EPSG:4326) from UTM easting and northing coordinates for use later in the workflow. To increase computational efficiency, we allow for multicore processing and the use of targets::crew_controller_local() function within this workflow. This reduces processing time substantially as processing thousands of polygons is quite time consuming. If you are running this workflow on your own computer, the length of time that it takes to calculate POIs will be dependent on the number of cores you allow for processing (we used 11 cores during the development of this workflow and it takes on the order of tens of minutes). 3.1.4 Flagging shoreline proximity Within the context of lakeSR, we do not identify whether there are multiple waterbodies/visible water sources within the site buffer used for lakeSR extraction. We do offer two flags to help users assess possibilities of shoreline contamination through a simple calculation. This calculation is based on the distance to shore calculated in the POI step, which does not account for differing shoreline locations due to water surface level change. A flagged pixel for shoreline proximity also does not imply that the data are contaminated, rather is intended as a diagnostic tool to identify sites that may be more likely to have some sort of shoreline contamination. To determine the possibility of shoreline contamination, we add the site buffer used for GEE extraction (defined in the lakeSR GEE configuration file) to the pixel size of the sensor used for reflectance detection (see Section 5.2.2 for details). For optical bands (Red, Green, Blue, Nir, Swir) we use the site buffer plus 30 meters. For thermal bands, we create 3 flag columns for each sensor’s (Landsat 4/5: TM, Landsat 7: ETM, Landsat 8/9: TIRS) native thermal resolution (120, 60, 100 meters). These flags are binary: 0: unlikely shoreline contamination (distance to shore is greater than the sum of the site buffer and pixel size) 1: possible shoreline contamination (distance to shore is less than or equal to sum of the site buffer and pixel size) 3.1.5 Case Study: Wisconsin Waterbodies The state of Wisconsin contains more than 15,000 freshwater lakes. LimnoSat-US contained just 2,694 waterbodies within Wisconsin (Figure 3.2), whereas AquaSat v2 via the lakeSR product includes 10,574 (Figure 3.3) - accounting for a majority of the state’s freshwater water bodies. Figure 3.2: Deepest point of Wisconsin lakes included in LimnoSat-US, defined by the Hydrolakes data product. Deepest point for each lake is indicated with a black dot. Figure 3.3: Point of inaccessibility for Wisconsin lakes included in AquaSat v2 via lakeSR, defined by the NHDPlusV2 data product. Point of inaccessibility for each lake is indicated with a black dot. 3.2 siteSR_WQP Acquisition Locations The AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP workflow outputs site metadata for all sites that are present after the harmonization procedure for each parameter. siteSR_WQP collates these sites, then reduces that collation to only distinct sites. Across chlorophyll-a, Secchi disc depth, and DOC, there are currently 315,892 distinct sites in the United States and Territories for which we create stacks. Every site in the WQP has a MonitoringLocationTypeName associated with it. For the purposes of siteSR_WQP, we do not subset the sites by these types, but they are helpful for understanding the type of data included in siteSR_WQP. Figure 3.4: Water Quality Portal data location types present in siteSR_WQP. Unique WQP monitoring location count above bar, divided by MonitoringLocationTypeName. For siteSR, we will acquire Landsat stacks for all sites deemed “visible” by remote sensing (see Section 3.2.1). Note that this is different from lakeSR, where we only acquire data for lakes, reservoirs, ponds, and streams according to the NHD. This was a functional choice, as most canal sites will not be RS-visible and estuary extents are limited in the NHD (and when present the technique to determine the POI may not be appropriate). 3.2.1 Assessing for RS visibility We use the JRC Global Surface Water Mapping Layers v1.4 (Pekel et al. 2016) to determine whether or not sites are visible by remote sensing and should therefore be sent through the GEE data acquisition process detailed in Section 6. This dataset is a compilation of 38 years of the Landsat record and enumerates the proportion of time a single 30x30 meter pixel has the presence of water. As long as a WQP monitoring location has at least one pixel within a 200 meter radius that has had water at least 80% of the time during that 38 year period, we include it in the list of sites we acquire Landsat stacks for. After this assessment, 111,347 sites were deemed to be visible by remote sensing. Figure 3.5: Water Quality Portal data location types present in siteSR_WQP after filitering for those that are deemed visible by remote sensing. Count of sites provided above bar, divided by MonitoringLocationTypeName. 3.2.2 Assignment of NHD flowline and waterbodies For each WQP montioring location, we attempt to assign HUC8’s wherever they are missing from the HUCEightDigitCode column output from the WQP (n = 2757). To do this we use the get_huc() function from {nhdplusTools} (Blodgett and Johnson 2023) package in R. After HUC8 assignment is finished only 27 sites remained without a HUC8 assignment. All of these sites were coastal sites outside of the extent of NHD boundaries. In siteSR_WQP, the flag_HUC8 column indicates whether this HUC8 was assigned within the WQP (value of 0), assigned in this process (value of 1), or was unable to be assigned (value of 2). Using the HUC8 information to iterate, we then can use {nhdplusTools} to assign waterbodies and flowlines to sites within the CONUS and data from The National Map best resolution files (e.g. US Geological Survey 2023b) for sites outside of CONUS by HUC4. For all sites with a MonitoringLocationTypeName that contains the words “lake” or “reservoir”, we assign NHD ids to each point for the waterbody it is contained by or the waterbody it is closest to. NHD waterbody file has been filtered to only contain Lake, Ponds, and Reservoirs (NHD feature types 390 and 436) when performing this task. We flag (flag_wb) the results of this assignment as follows: 0: point inside NHD waterbody polygon 1: point within GEE buffer distance (default 200 m for siteSR) proximate to NHD waterbody 2: point between GEE buffer distance and 500m proximate to NHD waterbody polygon 3: point unable to be assigned to waterbody (it is &gt; 500m proximate to NHD waterbody polygon) 4: point does not have HUC8 assignment or MonitoringLocationTypeName does not contain “lake” or “reservoir”. No waterbody is assigned. For all points with a flag value of 0 or 1 we provide the NHD identifier for the polygon the monitoring location is associated with (comid for NHDPlusV2 and permanent identifier for NHD Best Resolution), for all points with a flag value of 1 or 2, we provide the distance (in meters) to the nearest NHD waterbody of feature type 390 or 436. For waterbodies with a flag of 0, we provide distance to shore. We follow lakeSR’s implementation of flags for shoreline proximity for these sites as well, but with the siteSR default site buffer of 200 m instead of lakeSR’s buffer of 120 m. Flowlines are assigned to sites with a MonitoringLocationTypeName that contains “lake”, “reservoir”, “stream”, or “river”. NHD flowlines are filtered to contain streams/rivers and artificial paths (that is flowlines in waterbodies) (NHD feature types 460 and 558). We flag (flag_fl) the results of this assignment as follows: 0: point &lt;= 100m proximate to flowline 1: point between 100m and GEE buffer distance (default 200 m for siteSR) proximate to flowline 2: point between GEE buffer distance and 500 m proximate to flowline 3: point unable to be assigned to flowline for a stream site because distance to nearest stream &gt; 500 m 4: point is a lake or reservoir site and is &gt; 500m proximate to flowline 5: point does not have HUC8 assignment or MonitoringLocationTypeName does not contain “stream”, “river”, “lake”, or “reservoir”. No flowline assigned. For all points with a flag 0/1/2 we provide the NHD identifier for the flowline the monitoring location is associated with (comid for NHDPlusV2 and permanent identifier for NHD Best Resolution), for all points with a flag value of 1-3, we provide the distance (in meters) to the nearest NHD flowline of feature type 460 or 558. For all sites, we calculate how many waterbodies or flowlines are within the buffer distance set in the siteSR GEE configuration file. Any site that has more than one waterbody and/or flow line within the buffer distance may be including reflectance data from another surface water source. Within the context of siteSR, we do not investigate what, if any, impacts multiple waterbodies, flowlines, or combinations thereof have on the validity of the reflectance data or thermal data summary. We provide these identifiers and additional metadata to help users make informed decisions about data quality that may be inferred through the information included in these columns relative to the remote sensing data obtained in siteSR, they are present to assist in data interpretation. 3.2.3 siteSR_WQP updates in AquaSat v2 In our updated workflow, we acquire and provide the historical Landsat stacks for all sites collated from the harmonization pipeline, regardless of whether they are associated with a specific in situ observation. In the previous iteration, we only provided a matchup dataset for in situ data. Assigning flowlines and waterbodies to all siteSR sites is also a feature introduced in AquaSat v2.

While the orchestration of data acquisition is performed by the {targets} workflow, all code directly related to GEE data acquisition is written in Python. If you are running the ‘default’ configuration for lakeSR or siteSR the following directions are not applicable. 4.1 {reticulate} Conda Environment RStudio (Posit team 2023) is an IDE that, alongside the {reticulate} package (Ushey, Allaire, and Tang 2023), facilitates integration of R and Python code within the same environment. In AquaSat v2, we use a single R script to set up a {reticulate} Conda environment that is invoked at the beginning of a {targets} run to be sure that our Python code runs consistently. Python and python module Software/Python Module version citation Python 3.10.13 Python Software Foundation, www.python.org earthengine-api 1.4.0 Gorelick (2023) pandas 2.0.3 The pandas development team (2023) pyreadr 0.5.2 Fajardo (2023) PyYAML 6.0.2 The PyYAML Project, https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml numpy 1.24.4 Harris et al. (2020) The script run_targets.Rmd includes the steps to create this environment and authenticate your GEE user. These steps should be run prior to running the pipeline to assure a smooth run of the workflow. 4.2 Google Earth Engine Setup If running the ‘admin_update’ configuration for either lakeSR or siteSR, you will need to have a GEE account ((ref?)(create-account)), the gcloud CLI installed and configured ((ref?)(gcloud)), create an Earth Engine Project ((ref?)(proj-setting)), have successful authenticated your account ((ref?)(auth)), and you will need to alter the configuration file (described in Section 4.2.3). 4.2.1 Create a GEE account Creation of a GEE account is free. Click ‘Get Started’ at the far right side of the earthengine.google.com webpage to create an account: 4.2.2 gcloud CLI This workflow requires the installation and initiation of gcloud CLI, a command-line tool set for accessing Google Cloud Resources. All settings for AquaSat v2 are default gcloud configurations using a single GEE project. The link above documents how to set up gcloud. 4.2.3 GEE project setting AquaSat v2 is run in a specific GEE project associated with our authenticated Google account. If you wish to re-run this code as written, you will not have proper access because the code refers to our specific GEE project. You will need to update the config yaml (in lakeSR: b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config_poi.yml, in siteSR_WQP: gee_config.yml) with your Google credentials and GEE project in order to run the pipeline locally. If you are new to GEE, go to code.earthengine.google.com and enter the project name listed in the top right hand corner of your screen: Header of code.earthengine.google.com with current Earth Engine project highlighted in the red box to the right. Alternatively, you can create an GEE project for this task in the dropdown menu accessed by clicking on the icon to the right of the highlighted box in the figure above. This workflow will not run without specifying an Earth Engine Project that is managed by the Google Account you authenticate this run with. 4.2.4 GEE Authentication Once gcloud is installed and initialized, the configuration file is properly set up, and the Conda environment is set up, you can authenticate your GEE instance. For this workflow, this is completed in the run_targets.Rmd script at the root directory. This script provides explicit directions to complete this task before running the pipeline.

There were extensive changes to the data storage and metadata when moving from Collection 1 to C2. An overview of the differences is available as a PDF download here from the USGS. AquaSat v1 and LimnoSat-US were based on Collection 1 data, which are no longer available from the USGS and have been superseded by Collection 2 data. Data Tier: a data tier for Landsat refers to data quality and processing. lakeSR uses Tier 1 data exclusively which conform to the highest level of data quality. To learn more about Landsat tiers, see this video from the USGS. Data Processing Level (Level): a data processing level for Landsat refers to how much the data have been processed. Level 1 (top of atmosphere) is less processed than Level 2 (surface reflectance). lakeSR uses Level 2 data exclusively, as it has gone through a standard atmospheric correction process that attempts to standardize data handling through out the Landsat record - it is derived from Level 1 data. NASA has compiled a list of general data processing levels and descriptions here. Landsat stack: this is the collated Landsat historical dataset at a specific location. Matchup: a pair of observations, one from an in situ source, one from a remote sensing source. Matchups are often defined by a time window relative to the time of the in situ measurement, both before and after. 5.2 Background Information The information presented in this section originates from the NASA Landsat Science website and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR. The Landsat archive of multispectral and thermal data in lakeSR is composed of Landsat missions 4 through 9 and spans more than 40 years. Mission and Sensor Launch Date End of Science Mission Decommission Date Landsat 4 TM (EROS Center 2020a) 1982-07-16 1993-12-14 2001-06-15 Landsat 5 TM (EROS Center 2020a) 1984-03-01 2011-11-18 2013-06-05 Landsat 7 ETM+ (EROS Center 2020b) 1999-04-15 2022-04-06 N/A Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (EROS Center 2020c) 2013-02-11 N/A N/A Landsat 9 OLI-2/TIRS-2 (EROS Center 2020c) 2021-09-27 N/A N/A The image record for Landsat 4 is not consistent nor robust due to a data transmitter failure early in service, however our pipeline acquires data as available. Landsat 6 did not achieve orbit. For the purposes of AquaSat v2, we truncate the data record for Landsat 4 and 5 at the end of the Science Mission of the satellite. No corrections were made for the Landsat 7 scanline error that began on May 31, 2003, data were collected as available despite the scanline error since the data are still of acceptable quality per the USGS. Additionally, Landsat 7 began to experience orbital drift beginning in 2017, resulting in top-of-atmosphere (and therefore also surface reflectance) values that had growing uncertainties over time as the drift increased (Qiu et al. 2021). Qui (2021) suggests that data are not robust enough for trend analysis after the start of the growing season in 2020, but because their analysis was of NDVI, we conservatively truncate the data at the end of 2019. 5.2.1 Spectral Response While the nominal bands for each of the missions within the archive are relatively consistent (with the addition of an Aerosol band beginning Landsat 8), the precise spectral response for each nominal band shifted beginning with Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The image below visualizes the spectral response throughout the Landsat archive. Image credit: L. Rocchio and J. Barsi; NASA. (https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/article/the-intervening-atmosphere-tracing-the-provenance-of-a-favorite-landsat-infographic/) 5.2.2 Sensor Resolution The spatial resolution of the Level 1 data that the SR and ST products are derived from has not changed for optical bands over time (Aerosol, RGB, NIR, SWIR) but has varied over the historic record for thermal data: Sensors Optical Bands Thermal Bands TM 30 120 ETM+ 30 60 OLI/TIRS OLI-2/TIRS-2 30 100 All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have been resampled to 30m. Alongside the pixel resolution of the sensors is the radiometric resolution at which the data are stored. TM and ETM+ data are stored as 8-bit data products, OLI data are quantitized to 12 bits and Landsat 9 to 14 bits. This equates to 256 shades per band for Landsat 4-7, 4,096 shades for Landsat 8 and 16,384 shades for Landsat 9, where higher numbers allow for greater precision of measurement in a given band. All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have been rescaled to 16 bits. 5.3 Surface Reflectance Product The information presented in this section originates from the USGS Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR and siteSR products. The Landsat C2 SR product is a Level 2 data product that has been atmospherically corrected from the Level 1 Top of Atmosphere product using a myriad of inputs to create a reasonably consistent data product across space and time. The USGS EROS describes the SR product as follows: Surface reflectance improves comparison between multiple images over the same region by accounting for atmospheric effects such as aerosol scattering and thin clouds, which can help in the detection and characterization of Earth surface change. Surface reflectance is generated from Level-1 inputs that meet the &lt;76 degrees Solar Zenith Angle constraint and include the required auxiliary data inputs to generate a scientifically viable product. 5.3.1 SR Atmospheric Processing The SR product for Landsat 4-7 is calculated using the Land Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) (Schmidt et al. 2013) and Landsat 8 and 9 SR data are calculated using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) algorithm (Vermote et al. 2018). The two algorithms are functionally different, but the outcome is the same: a consistently-processed surface reflectance product that is available worldwide. See the table under section heading ‘Differences in Surface Reflectance Processing Algorithms’ on the USGS Landsat C2 website for details. 5.4 Surface Temperature The information presented in this section originates from the USGS Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR and siteSR products. The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature (ST) product is calculated using a single-channel algorithm (M. J. Cook 2014; M. Cook et al. 2014) to convert the thermal band data to temperature estimates in degrees Kelvin. While these data are considered interoperable over space and time with few differences in the ST algorithm product within Collection 2, there do appear to be slight differences in the ST product between sensors. Like with the surface reflectance product, we calculate between-mission handoffs for the TM/ETM/TIRS products in Section 8. It is important to note that the thermal band resolution is coarser than the optical bands in all Landsat missions (see Section 5.2.2). At this time we do not account for mixed thermal pixel boundaries due to the difference in pixel resolution between optical and thermal sensors in lakeSR or siteSR outside of the flags described in Section 3.1.4 and Section 3.2.2. Additional data handling may be necessary to use these data as precise estimates of water surface temperature given these constraints. We do provide surface temperature summary statistics in the siteSR product as well, and users should approach the data with caution when a WQP monitoring site is near to a shoreline. While we do not have explicit guidance for the use of the surface temperature estimates for siteSR, we do provide some characteristics of sites and their relationships to NHD flowlines and waterbodies (see Section 3.2.2 additional descriptors). Users could use a combination of MonitoringLocationTypeName, the flags assigned from our NHD assignment process, and the distance columns from that process to assess whether or not the temperature data is appropriate for a given site. Additional assessments may be necessary to assess whether it is appropriate to use the temperature data for discrete analysis of temperature trends/patterns. King, et al. (-King, Bean, and Gohring (2024)) have noted that handoff coefficients should be used for the surface temperature product as well, see Section 8 for details.

This data product contains “full stacks” of the Landsat Collection 2 record - that is, all summarized Landsat data available from all Landsat missions that met our within-image QA criteria. The siteSR data product is similar, but is acquired at unique sampling locations as described in 3.2. 6.1 Changes from AquaSat v1 and LimnoSat-US While much of the general architecture from the precedent data products remained unchanged, in AquaSat v2 we have added a number of features to the remote sensing acquisition workflow, have increased efficiency of the data pull, and have made the acquired data more robust through additional masking. The bullets below summarize the changes implemented in this update. using yaml file for configuration of the workflow. This allows for greater flexibility in data acquisition including the use of custom configurations for the pull. assuring location and buffer area are completely contained in a path-row prior to pulling the data. This reduces erroneous counts of pixels for locations and buffers that are at the edge of a path-row, assuring that the buffer distance and included area is consistent per location if it is in the area of path-row overlap. Cartoon example: Locations (and their buffers) are the blue circles and the extent of the path-row is indicated by the large dark blue or orange boxes. In this example, location 1 would be extracted for both path-row 1 and 2, location 2 only extracted for path-row 2, and location 3 only extracted for path-row 1. inclusion of Landsat 4 and Landsat 9. At the time of AquaSat v1 and LimnoSat-US, Landsat 4 was not easily integrated with other Landsat missions due to data storage differences. Collection 2 updates allowed for easier interoperability of the TM sensor (Landsat 4) image series and have therefore been included in the update. Additionally, Landsat 9 came online in 2021, and has been added to the data product. Landsat Collection 2 offers a Surface Temperature product derived from the thermal band. In AquaSat v2, we include data from this band. See Section 5.4 for additional considerations in use of these data. sending tasks to GEE explicitly per path-row and limiting the Landsat stack to the explicit path-row to eliminate duplicate acquisitions. In the previous products, duplicate location/path-row data were acquired because the extracted Landsat stack was not limited to the explicit WRS path-row that the point was in. This meant that locations that were in a path-row overlap would be extracted twice in two different WRS path-row extents. The code below is an example of this type of filtering that occurs as we run a path-row extraction, where we once clipped the stack to the AOI of the path-row. # separate the path-row into path and row values wrs_pathrow = &quot;013031&quot; w_p = int(str(wrs_pathrow)[:3]) w_r = int(str(wrs_pathrow)[-3:]) # filter the Landsat 7 Collection 2 Tier 1 Level 2 product for the path, row, and valid dates l7 = (ee.ImageCollection(&quot;LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2&quot;) .filter(ee.Filter.eq(&quot;WRS_PATH&quot;, w_p)) .filter(ee.Filter.eq(&quot;WRS_ROW&quot;, w_r)) .filterDate(&#39;1999-05-28&#39;, &#39;2019-12-31&#39;)) filtering for valid mission dates at Landsat stack step. As seen in the code chunk above, we also filter for the valid mission dates as detailed in Section 5.2 - in the previous version this was completed after the Landsat stack was acquired. implementation of Collection 2 updates, specifically scaling changes and updated QA band conventions. The updated scaling factor function is as follows as directed by the US Geological Survey (2021) and US Geological Survey (2024) documents. def apply_scale_factors(image): &quot;&quot;&quot; Applies scaling factors for Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance and surface temperature products Args: image: one ee.Image of an ee.ImageCollection Returns: ee.Image with band values overwritten by scaling factors &quot;&quot;&quot; opticalBands = image.select(&#39;SR_B.&#39;).multiply(0.0000275).add(-0.2) thermalBands = image.select(&#39;ST_B.*&#39;).multiply(0.00341802).add(149.0) return (image .addBands(opticalBands, None, True) .addBands(thermalBands, None, True)) masking changes. Many updates were made to assure high quality data through the use of updated masking procedures. The following masks were added in this workflow and are detailed below in Section 6.3.1: apply_fill_mask_457, apply_fill_mask_89, add_realistic_mask_457, add_realistic_mask_89, add_opac_mask (Landsat 4, 5, 7 only), add_sr_aero_mask (Landsat 8, 9 only). The cloud mask was also updated to include all sources of contamination (including cloud shadow and dilated clouds) in addition to clouds, snow, and ice. The proportion of pixels within the location buffer that were masked out due to clouds is now tracked as prop_clouds as an additional method of QA handling downstream of the GEE extraction. DSWE-like implementation for water detection. We have moved from using the JRC Global Surface Water Mapping Layers Pekel et al. (2016) to using a modified Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) algorithm based on the USGS implementation of DSWE described in LSDS-2042 version 3 (US Geological Survey 2023a). See Section 6.3.2 for details. removing no-data acquisitions before GEE export. In the AquaSat v2 update, we remove any rows from the summarized GEE product before export. This adds efficiency to the pull by removing those rows before export, which is a source of added time in the GEE bottleneck. checking for failed tasks. We added a sanity check for failed tasks, since task status is not conveyed from GEE. 6.2 Overview of Acquisition Steps The workflow for data acquisition from GEE for lakeSR and siteSR is as follows: read in and format the yaml configuration file for the GEE run reformat the locations file for the GEE run using the configuration file determine the WRS-2 path-rows that intersect with the locations file filter the locations for those that are completely contained by the WRS-2 path-row when the automated buffer is added, add the WRS-2 path-rows to the reformatted locations, and save distinct location files by path-row for easier processing in Python iteratively run the GEE script per WRS-2 path-row check to see that all tasks are complete in GEE before moving to next step check to see if any tasks failed in GEE extraction which is not visible from the RStudio IDE 6.2.1 Creating a Custom Configuration File lakeSR (and siteSR) can be modified to be run by a user by setting up a new config file and altering the {targets} workflow to point to that config file. To configure a new run of this workflow, fill out the yaml file at the file path b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config.yml for lakeSR and gee_config.yml for siteSR. To run the pipeline with this custom configuration, follow the steps in run_targets.Rmd, which will assure proper set up and run the pipeline. If you wish to make changes to any processes that are not indicated in the config file (using a different set of lakes/source files, remote sensing masking procedures, summary statistics, QAQC filtering, mission handoff corrections, etc.) we encourage you to do so. Just remember, this pipeline takes days to run due to the bottleneck when submitting tasks to Google Earth Engine. If you wish to extract remote sensing data for specific locations in a lake, we encourage you to look to our siteSR data product which is more suited to extracting data of that nature. Please note, calculating hand-off coefficients from small numbers of lakes may not provide robust enough summary statistics for intermission comparison and timeseries analysis. See Section 8 for additional guidance. 6.3 Technical Implementation of GEE Acquisition Script In order to cue Python scripts and map along WRS-2 path-rows within the {targets} architecture, we use a function run_GEE_per_pathrow() which writes the current WRS-2 path-row to a text file, then sources a python script that uses that text file to run the acquisition for the path-row. Additional details are provided below to describe the steps in the python script (run_GEE_per_pathrow.py). 6.3.1 Custom Earth Engine Masking Functions The first section of run_GEE_per_pathrow.py saves custom functions used in the Landsat stack acquisition. These include data manipulation to create Earth Engine (EE) objects, custom QA masks, DSWE algorithm, and the functions that perform the masking and extraction of data from the Landsat image. Below is an overview of some of the custom masking procedures and their justification, if applicable. We use the most aggressive masking procedures in the lakeSR and siteSR products in order to attempt to have consistent and robust data across such a large area of data acquisition. An interactive masking viewer is available for select scenes for Landsat 4/5/7 and Landsat 8/9 to see some of the masks in action. apply_rad_mask: Masks out all pixels that are radiometrically saturated in any optical band using the QA_RADSAT QA band. The Landsat User Guides (US Geological Survey 2021, 2024) note that radiometrically saturated data are “unusable”. Saturated bands happen infrequently in Landsat 8 and 9, but we still apply this mask to all Landsat mission data for continuity. add_cf_mask: Adds a mask band for any pixels obstructed by clouds and snow/ice using the CLOUD_QA band. This is a general QA band that describes clouds/snow/ice detected by algorithms defined by the atmospheric processing procedure. We have elected to only include pixels that do not contain clouds, cloud shadows, dispersed clouds, or snow/ice as defined by this band. In particular, we follow the suggestions in the product User Guide (US Geological Survey 2021, 2024) Users are advised to engage the QA “Dilated Cloud” (bit 1) AND “Cloud” (bit 3) OFF condition to correctly identify clear pixels over water. add_sr_aero_mask: Adds a mask band for any pixels in Landsat 8 and 9 that have ‘medium’ or ‘high’ aerosol QA flags from the SR_QA_AEROSOL band. Because water is particularly difficult to assess from space, we are more aggressive in this mask than suggested by the Landsat 8 and 9 User Guide (US Geological Survey 2024) which states: “Note that pixels classified as high aerosol content are not recommended for use.” add_opac_mask: Adds a mask band to remove pixels where atmospheric opacity is greater than 0.3 in Landsat 4, 5, and 7 using the SR_ATMOS_OPACITY band. For similar reasons as a more aggressive aerosol mask in Landsat 8 &amp; 9, we use this mask in addition to the cloud mask (apply_cf_mask). The Landsat 4-7 User Guide (US Geological Survey 2021) states the following about the atmospheric opacity values: A general interpretation of atmospheric opacity is that values less than 0.1 are clear, 0.1-0.3 are average, and values greater than 0.3 indicate haze or other cloud situations. SR values from pixels with high atmospheric opacity will be less reliable, especially under high solar zenith angle conditions. apply_fill_mask_457 and apply_fill_mask_89: Adds a mask band where any band value is 0 before applying scaling factors to bands. Filled values are infrequent; however, when acquiring data across such a large area and time they are bound to happen. add_realistic_mask_457 and add_realistic_mask_89: Adds a mask band where any band is less than -0.01 after scaling, indicating overcorrection of SR product. While the stated minimum value of the ‘valid range’ for the SR product is 7273 prior to application of scaling factors (0.0000075 after scaling), we know that the Level-2 Surface Reflectance product has been fine-tuned on terrestrial data and small over-corrections of surface reflectance, especially over dark surfaces, is likely to happen. We explicitly allow for very small negative reflectance values to be sure we do not remove very deep, oligotrophic and/or high DOC water systems from our data set while implementing this QA filter. add_glint_mask: Adds a mask band where any optical band is &gt; 0.2, indicating likely sun glint artifacts. add_ir_glint_flag: Adds a band where any near infrared or shortwave infrared value is greater than 0.1, but does not mask the pixel. This flag is meant to be a diagnostic for downstream users to make additional qualititative assessment of sun glint affected data and is tallied with all masks implemented. We track pixel-level instances of the use of the aerosol mask in Landsat 8/9, the opacity mask in Landsat 4/5/7, the realistic mask (holistically and per band), and the sun glint mask (holistically and per band) in our GEE workflow. These tallies represent the number of pixels masked for each QA procedure prior to summarizing the data within the buffered area. 6.3.2 Defining water area We use an adapted version Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) algorithm to define what pixels are water within the buffer of our specific locations. DSWE was defined in Jones (2019) for Landsat Collection 1 and re-implemented for Collection 2 as a Level-3 data product in US Geological Survey (2023a). Differences between the Level-3 implementation and the on-the-fly calculation made within our workflow are as follows: we use the Level 2 SR product instead of the Level 2 Analysis Ready Data Product to calculate DSWE threshold values we mask any DSWE values that are not fully illuminated (a value of 0 in the function below) as defined by the ee.Terrain.hillShadow function in Google Earth Engine using the MERIT DEM version 1.0.3 (Yamazaki et al. 2017) at an extent of 3000 meters surrounding a given point for analysis. Screen shot of code used for implementation of hill shadow to determine masking procedures of the DSWE value. This is different from the implementation described in the Level 3 data product which uses a set of hillshade and landcover thresholds to determine whether or not the resulting DSWE value should be masked. Based on extensive visual inspection, our adaptation seems to label pixels as expected. Our implementation of the DSWE algorithm results in the following values per pixel based on the thresholds described in US Geological Survey (2023a) table 2.2 and 2.3 a value of 0 indicates no water/fill 1 is confident water 2 is low confidence water 3 is high confidence partial water (or vegetated water) 4 is low confidence partial water Within the scope of lakeSR and siteSR, we tabulate pixels that are a DSWE value of 1 (DSWE1) for high confidence open water, or what we call DSWE1a - high confidence open water OR the pixel meets a threshold that may indicate there is surface-level algae. The algae mask is defined as when a pixel has a DSWE value greater than 1 and the green band scaled value is greater than 0.05 and the red band scaled value is less than 0.04. These values are based on optical properties intended to mimic the spectral response of chlorophyll a as described by Burket, Olmanson, and Brezonik (2023). This is an experimental mask, so we export both DSWE1 and DSWE1a summaries within lakeSR. We have found some omission error within DSWE1 for visible floating scum within river systems and this additional mask captures many of those pixels without adding unnecessary uncertainty. Users of the lakeSR and siteSR data products can choose to use the DSWE1a product if applicable to their research, however, this threshold was defined in the Illinois and Ohio Rivers and may not be applicable in all environments. 6.4 Additional diagnostic data columns During the masking and flagging step of the workflow, we tally pixels that met certain criteria for use as diagnostic tools. This includes tallying of varying DSWE types (greater than 0 – water of some kind with any confidence, 1 high confidence water, 1a high confidence water with positive algal mask, 3 high confidence vegetated water) within the buffered area. These tallies are of any pixel that meets the DSWE category and met the hillshade, cloud, opacity/aerosol, realistic, and glint thresholds. The number of pixels that were high opacity/high aerosol, overly negative values, and likely sun glint were also tallied within the buffer. These tallies are of the entire buffer area and no additional masks are incorporated into the tallies (e.g. the sun glint mask and infrared mask may also indicate high reflectance from shoreline vegetation within the buffered area). Counts of pixels were tallied per band to indicate the number of pixels that were below zero, below the threshold for realistic values, or above the glint threshold. These tallies were completed in conjunction with the hillshade, cloud, opacity/aerosol and DSWE masks, representing the number of pixels that were masked after the baseline pixel QA process. The number of pixels that had infrared reflectance values (NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2) greater than 0.1 were also tallied, but these pixels were not masked out. Columns for the proportion of pixels masked by clouds and shaded by terrain are also provided, no additive mask is used when tallying these pixels. These tallies are meant to be used as diagnostic tools for further quality control and modeling purposes, though we do not have recommended uses at this time. 6.5 Payload handling Because GEE is a free service to those at academic or governmental institutions, there are limits to the total number of tasks being run co-currently on GEE’s platform. For this reason, tasks are sent to GEE as path-row groups as soon as there are fewer than 10 tasks in the GEE tasks queue. Additionally, any pathrow containing more than 5,000 POI locations are sent as separate tasks in 5000 location chunks. This is an additional step that is taken in addition to processing per path-row to avoid failed tasks. We have also implemented a status check for tasks sent to GEE to determine if any have failed (target b_check_for_failed_tasks), as once the tasks are sent from the RStudio IDE, you can not tell whether or not they have completed or failed. This stores a text file at the filepath b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/out/GEE_task_errors_vRUN_DATE.csv containing the names of the tasks that have failed. If no tasks have failed, no file will be present. Generally speaking failed tasks would indicate an error within the GEE acquisition script, usually due to changes in the b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/py/run_GEE_per_pathrow.py script. We recommend checking the task status of the GEE run at https://code.earthengine.google.com/tasks after any changes to that file, which will indicate if tasks are failing without waiting for the total completion of the GEE target.

"],["post-hoc-qa.html", "7 Post-Hoc Quality Assurance 7.1 Raw lakeSR stack collation 7.2 Post-hoc filters", " 7 Post-Hoc Quality Assurance Up until this point in the workflow, no data filtering has occurred other than the masking procedures that eliminate obviously contaminated pixel-level data due to sensor malfunction, clouds, haze, and glint as described in Section 6.3.1. We also implement further QA filters for the remote sensing stacks to assure high-quality data. These post-hoc filters are described in 7.2. 7.1 Raw lakeSR stack collation The data exported from the GEE tasks described in Section 6 were collated into large compressed .feather files per DSWE type (DSWE1 and DSWE1a), per Landsat mission, and per path prefix. The path prefix subset is designed to reduce data corruption due to file size in the upload/download process to Google Drive, where the collated files are stored for posterity and to add functionality to this workflow. The Google Drive ids can be found at the folder path c_collate_Landsat_data/out/ and can be accessed without special were collated into large compressed .feather files per DSWE type (DSWE1 and DSWE1a), per Landsat mission, and per path prefix. The path prefix subset is designed to reduce data corruption due to file size in the upload/download process to Google Drive, where the collated files are stored for posterity and to add functionality to this workflow. The Google Drive ids can be found at the folder path c_collate_Landsat_data/out/ and can be accessed without special permissions by downstream users. Many of these files are quite large (on the order of many GBs) and are very difficult to handle outside of a programming or database environment. We provide these files for advanced users who wish to make changes to the QAQC or intermission handoff procedures. At the time of running the pipeline, we assigned a max vector size (‘R_MAX_VSIZE’) of 40 GB using the .Renviron document in this repository and it was run on a machine with 64 GB of memory. If your system has less than 40 GB of memory, this portion of the workflow may not successfully run. 7.2 Post-hoc filters We acknowledge that even with the best masking procedures, our workflow may still result in erroneous or misleading SR values. To address this we implement post-hoc filters that are applied to the stack to reduce uncertainty in the remote sensing data as much as possible. image quality (acquired from scene-level metadata files) must be &gt;= 8. In Landsat 4, 5, and 7 this value is stored in the metadata column IMAGE_QUALITY, in Landsat 8 and 9, this value originates from the column IMAGE_QUALITY_OLI. These columns indicate the overall quality of the image on a scale of 0 (worst) to 9 (best). total count of pixels (pCount_dswe1 or pCount_dswe1a) contributing to summary values must be ≥ 8. This is a slight change from AquaSat v1 which required 10 pixels. Due to the more rigorous masking procedures (than AquaSat v1) we believe allows for a slightly more conservative QA filter via the reduction of required pixels for inclusion in the lakeSR and siteSR datasets. if the median temperature is below freezing (med_SurfaceTemp &lt; 273.15 ° K), the row is dropped. This is our best attempt at removing data during any freezing period and also is an attempt at detecting clouds which can impact the thermal estimates. In particular, cirrus clouds can go unnoticed in cloud detection algorithms used that inform our masking procedures. if the median temperature is greater than or equal to 40°C (313.15 °K) the row is dropped. This maximum was defined based on the maximum value included Willard et al. (2021) composed of in situ measurements and remote sensing estimates. either NIR surface reflectance or SWIR1 and SWIR2 surface reflectance must be &lt; 0.1, this is to remove any extracted samples where sun glint has likely affected the data that was not masked in the RGB bands. In aquatic environments, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 surface reflectance values should be very low and these bands can be used for detecting sun glint affected areas Vanhellemont (2019). Since NIR bands can be elevated in high-sediment waters (e.g., Doxaran, Froidefond, and Castaing 2002) and SWIR can be elevated in high chlorophyll environments (e.g, Hu 2009), and we did not wish to bias our dataset and remove data of this nature, we embraced this conditional approach. While there are numerous other diagnostic tests we could apply to filter the RS data, these are the QA filters that we deem to be the most universal for reliable RS data across the US and Territories. Figures in the sections below show how many rows of data were dropped through this QA process. For the purposes of this documentation, we show summaries for DSWE1 data only, but running the pipeline locally results in graphical summaries for both DSWE1 and DSWE1a data. 7.2.1 Landsat 4 QA Summary Summary of rows retained during siteSR Landsat 9’s quality filtering for DSWE1 (confident water) remote sensing summaries.

"],["define-handoff.html", "8 Calculating intermission handoffs 8.1 Roy method 8.2 Gardner method 8.3 Implementing Roy Handoffs 8.4 Implementing Gardner Handoffs", " 8 Calculating intermission handoffs It is necessary to standardize band values between Landsat missions in order to create a robust timeseries. Maciel et al. (2023) notes the issues in using the Landsat Surface Reflectance product as a timeseries without careful handling of data between missions. King, Bean, and Gohring (2024) notes that this type of standardization is necessary for the thermal band, as well. This standardization process attempts to address changes in sensor spectral response and atmospheric correction procedures. For the purposes of AquaSat v2, we call this standardization process “intermission handoffs”. We implement two versions of intermission handoffs: the method described in Roy et al. (2016) (“Roy method”) and an adapted version of that described in Gardner et al. (2021) (“Gardner method”). In AquaSat v2, we provide coefficients to standardize remote sensing values relative to Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. The Landsat 7 intermission handoffs create a continuous record of remote sensing from Landsat 4 through 9 relative to Landsat 7 since Landsat 4 and 5 and Landsat 8 and 9 can be treated as interchangeable due to the similarity in sensor payload and radiometric resolution. Data corrected to Landsat 8 relative values can only be applied to Landsat 7 due to lack of mission overlap between Landsat 8 and Landsat 5, so the resulting standardized data timeseries. For the purposes of this document, we only present the handoff coefficients for DSWE1 (confident water) and do not investigate differences between the DSWE1 or DSWE1a coefficients, though we provide both. Users should use these handoff coefficients if using data from more than one sensor group (TM, ETM+, OLI). 8.1 Roy method The Roy method for calculating intermission handoffs uses paired images at specific sites, where the reflectance data are obtained are from two missions (e.g. Landsat 7 and Landsat 8) separated by one day at a specific location within the overlapping paths in the WRS2 path-row framework: An example of two overlapping WRS2 paths (grey area) separated by one day. Any location with data for both images (in the grey area) would be considered a paired data point to define the Roy method intermission handoffs. While Roy et al. (2016) implemented this method on a pixel-by-pixel basis, we implement using the median band value per site. This is used in place of the explicit filters described in the Roy method (saturated pixels, cloudy/snowy pixels, and pixels with value changes greater than the changes in atmospheric correction), as we have implemented masks and QA filters to reduce these sources of error. Handoff coefficients are defined by the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression line or the Deming regression (MLE, assuming equal and constant error in both x and y variables). Because Deming regression is computationally intensive, the regression line is defined by a random sample of 10,000 matches. For the purposes of this documentation, we only include figures and tables for the Deming regression (minimum likelihood estimation method) and DSWE1. Intercepts and slopes for all handoffs are available at the file path e_calculate_handoffs/out/collated_handoffs_v2025-02-12.csv and figures for all handoffs are created when the pipeline is run. 8.2 Gardner method Gardner method intermission handoffs are defined by the data obtained in the overlapping period of time between two adjacent-in-time missions. These data are filtered to sites that have at least one data point per year for at least 75% of the years of overlap. The filtered data are then summarized to each mission’s 1st-99th percentile value per band, and the handoff coefficients between missions are defined by the second-order polynomial (quadratic) relationship between them. Because this method uses a second-order polynomial to define the handoff relationship, all input (x) values outside of the 1st and 99th percentile values used to define the intermission handoff should be used with extreme caution. One additional consideration when using the Gardner method is, even when the number of observations are is high, if there is a difference between total observations contributing to the quantile summaries, there may be systematic differences built into the coefficients. An example of possible systematic differences could be fewer observations from non-CONUS locations in Landsat 5 due to data transmission errors. We did not investigate the differences in n listed in Table 8.4 to determine what, if any, systematic differences are present between the two missions. We provide the Gardner method handoffs for continuity with the riverSR product for users who would like that interoperability. As with the Roy, et al. method, intercepts and slopes for all handoffs are available at the file path e_calculate_handoffs/out/collated_handoffs_v2025-02-12.csv and figures for all handoffs are created when the pipeline is run. 8.3 Implementing Roy Handoffs Table 8.1 describes the number of matches contributing to the intermission handoffs using the Roy method. We also include figures of the OLS/MLE relationships and the residuals for the MLE corrections in addition to a table of the coefficients for each DSWE1 MLE handoff.

To reduce output data product size, we do not apply these handoffs within the output data product, but rather provide users the tools to apply the handoffs to the filtered lakeSR and siteSR data.

To reduce output data product size, we do not apply these handoffs within the output data product, but rather provide users the tools to apply the handoffs to the filtered lakeSR and siteSR data.
