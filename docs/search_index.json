[["satellite-data-acquisition-software-and-settings.html", "3 Satellite Data Acquisition Software and Settings 3.1 {reticulate} Conda Environment", " 3 Satellite Data Acquisition Software and Settings Currently, all satellite data in AquaSat are obtained using the Python API for Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al. 2017). While the orchestration of data acquisition is performed by {targets}, a workflow management program for R, all code directly related to GEE data acquisition is written in Python. 3.1 {reticulate} Conda Environment RStudio (Posit team 2023) is an IDE that, alongside the {reticulate} package (Ushey, Allaire, and Tang 2023), facilitates integration of R and Python code within the same environment. In lakeSR, we use a singular R script to set up a {reticulate} Conda environment that is invoked at the beginning of a {targets} run (lines 8-12 of the _targets.R file) to be sure that our Python code runs consistently.
