This product, lakeSR, is a component of the AquaSat suite, an effort to create a database of lake and river water quality observations alongside remote sensing data. This is an update to the original AquaSat (Ross et al. 2019), the foundational effort towards making satellite and in situ water quality data accessible for freshwater monitoring. Currently, lakeSR is comprised of the historical Landsat record from 1984 until late 2024, comprised of data from the following missions: Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM) Landsat 5 TM Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS There will be additional satellite data incorporated into the lakeSR product in the future. lakeSR acquires tabular data summaries of satellite-derived surface reflectance and surface temperature data at central locations within a lake. The sibling product to this is siteSR, which acquires the same data at locations identified with monitoring records from the Water Quality Portal from the AquaMatch component of AquaSat. 1.1 Code Architecture lakeSR is built on the {targets} workflow management system for R (Landau 2021). The {targets} architecture is based on lists of functions performed in a specific order, each function called a target. The primary benefit of {targets} workflows is that code is only run if a target, a target’s code, or a target’s dependencies have changed (or become “outdated” in {targets} speak). lakeSR is broken down into groups of targets that perform specific tasks, listed below with a brief summary about what task(s) each group completes. This particular workflow incorporates both R and Python programming languages to complete these tasks. a_Calculate_Centers: This {targets} list calculates “Pole of Inaccessibility” (POI) (Garcia-Castellanos and Lombardo 2007) for all non-intermittent lakes, ponds, and reservoirs greater than 1 hectare in surface area and intermittent lakes, ponds, and reservoirs greater than 4 hectares using the NHDPlusV2 polygons using the {nhdplusTools} package (Blodgett and Johnson 2023) and the poi() function in the {polylabelr} package (Larsson 2020). For all waterbodies outside of CONUS, POI were calculated based on the NHD Best Resolution file for the entire state or territory. See Section 2 for additional background and detailed methodology. b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi: This {targets} group uses the configuration file b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config_poi.yml and the “Pole of Inaccessibility” points created in the a_Calculate_Centers group to pull Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) API. In this group, we use the most conservative LS4-7 pixel filters, as we are applying these settings across such a large continuum of time and space. This group ends with a branched target that sends tasks to Google Earth engine by mapping over WRS2 path rows that intersect with the points created in a_Calculate_Centers. Note: this group of targets takes a very, very long time, averaging about 1 hour per path-row branch. There are just under 800 path rows executed in this branch.

"],["locs-data-acq.html", "2 Locations of Data Acquisition 2.1 Changes from AquaSat v1 2.2 Pole of Inaccessibility 2.3 Waterbodies in AquaMatch-lakeSR 2.4 Technical Implementation 2.5 Case Study: Wisconsin Waterbodies", " 2 Locations of Data Acquisition As noted in the Introduction (Section 1), for the purposes of AquaSat, surface reflectance and surface temperature data are acquired at specific, centrally-located points within waterbodies (typically in pelagic locations of lakes, lakeSR) and at locations where there are in situ data (siteSR). The data acquired at locations where there are in situ data are meant to create location-specific algorithms using the AquaMatch database, which can then be applied to the data collected over the centrally-located point across all waterbodies in the lakeSR database. lakeSR does not acquire nor summarize data over the entire waterbody’s surface, as it is computationally impractical for most large lakes, especially those that cross multiple satellite path-rows or tiles. For both lakeSR and siteSR, we summarize the Landsat data within a 120m radius of a defined location. 2.1 Changes from AquaSat v1 Some changes in lake polygon and center point have been made in modernizing and scaling from the original AquaSat. The lake center aspect called “deepest point” of AquaSat v1 was built upon HydroLakes (Messager et al. 2016), a global database of lakes greater than 10 hectares accounting for 1.4 million waterbodies and a total surface area of 2.67 million km² worldwide. While this dataset of lakes represents ~55% of the worldwide surface area of lakes greater than 1 hectare, it is only a sliver of the estimated 27 million waterbodies in the world (Verpoorter et al. 2014). AquaSat v2 uses the USGS’s National Hydrography products which map the surface waters of the United States, and allows for reduction in minimum size of waterbody and an increase in coverage of freshwater systems across the United States and permanently inhabited territories. 2.2 Pole of Inaccessibility The USGS National Hydrography products contain smaller waterbodies and higher resolution polygons than the HydroLakes shapes, which makes it computationally impossible to use the Chebyshev Center (“deepest point”, Yang (2020)) calculation used in AquaSat v1 due to the number of vertices in each polygon. To replace this important step in the update, we employ the concept of “pole of inaccessibility” (POI) (Stefansson 1920), which can handle complex polygons in the R environment with minimal computational investment. The concept of POI is used to define the geographic center of a circle with the largest circumference within any complex polygon. The foundational principle is used widely to describe the arctic pole of inaccessiblity, that is the point in the northern arctic circle that is the furthest from land, but has also been used to describe the geographic center of landmasses (Garcia-Castellanos and Lombardo 2007). For lakeSR, we use POI to determine the point in a waterbody that is furthest from the shoreline using the polylabelr::poi() function (Larsson 2020), which calculates a point in space and the radius of the circle used to define the POI. 2.3 Waterbodies in AquaMatch-lakeSR For lakeSR, we use the NHDPlusV2 dataset for lakes within the conterminous US and US Territories using the {nhdplusTools} R package (Blodgett and Johnson 2023) and the NHD Best Resolution (US Geological Survey, n.d.b) data through The National Map. All HUC4s were downloaded and processed in November 2024 using the most updated version available at the time of download. Figure 2.1: NHD HUC4 map for the United States and Territories, courtesy of the USGS. For every HUC4 in the United States and Territories (Figure 2.1), all waterbodies are limited to those with NHD Waterbody Subtypes belonging to the following groups: 390 (lake/pond) and 436 (reservoir) and are at least 0.01 km2 (1 hectare) in area according to the area value provided in the NHD file. If the feature type (FType) of the waterbody belonged to an intermittent category (39001, 39005, 39006, 43614) the threshold for inclusion was increased to 0.04 km2 (4 hectares) to reduce processing time when extracting data from Google Earth Engine. This filtering resulted in 729,941 waterbodies included in our dataset, including 313,248 non-CONUS waterbodies. This is a 1,185 percent increase over the 56,792 lakes included in the original AquaSat product. For each waterbody, the POI and distance-to-shore radius was calculated using the polylabelr::poi() function. It is important to note that the poi() function can sometimes attribute a POI to a location other than the point furthest away from a shoreline. This occurs in polygons with a very large number of indices (due to sheer area or geomorphological complexity); however the points calculated should be an acceptable proxy for pelagic lake conditions. 2.4 Technical Implementation The code for gathering NHD waterbodies and calculating their respective POIs is found in {targets} group a_Calculate_Centers which is located in the script a_Calculate_Centers.R at the root directory of the repository. The processing begins by acquiring the polygons of all US states and territories using the {tigris} package (Walker 2023). These polygons are used to acquire a list HUC4s that intersect with each municipal boundary using the nhdplusTools::get_huc() function, which are then reduced to distinct HUC4’s and transformed into a vector of HUC4s. HUC4s are then split into CONUS (HUC4 &lt; 1900) and non-CONUS (HUC4 ≥ 1900) groups. To efficiently calculate the POI across hundreds of HUC4s, we use the dynamic branching feature to iterate over each HUC4. For each HUC4, the NHDPlusV2 (CONUS) or NHD Best Resolution (non CONUS) waterbodies are acquired and filtered for lake/ponds and reservoirs of at least 1 hectare in area or 4 hectares for intermittent lake/ponds or reservoirs. In order to accurately calculate distance-to-shore when using the polylabelr::poi() function as described in Section 2.3, each waterbody was converted to the proper Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection calculated from the mean longitudinal value of the polygon vertices prior to applying the poi() function. By using the point-local UTM projection, we decrease distortion expected from any single CRS used to represent all of the locations from which we have lakes. The latitude and longitude values of the POI were transformed to decimal degrees in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84, EPSG:4326) from UTM easting and northing coordinates for use later in the workflow. To increase computational efficiency, we allow for multicore processing and the use of targets::crew_controller_local() function within this workflow. This reduces processing time substantially as processing thousands of polygons is quite time consuming. If you are running this workflow on your own computer, the length of time that it takes to calculate POIs will be dependent on the number of cores you allow for processing (we used 11 cores during the development of this workflow and it takes on the order of tens of minutes). 2.5 Case Study: Wisconsin Waterbodies The state of Wisconsin contains more than 15,000 freshwater lakes. AquaSat v1 contained just 2,694 waterbodies within Wisconsin (Figure 2.2), whereas the our update includes 10,574 (Figure 2.3) - accounting for a majority of the state’s freshwater water bodies.

Figure 2.3: Point of inaccessibility for Wisconsin lakes included in AquaSat v2, defined by the NHDPlusV2 data product. Point of inaccessibility for each lake is indicated with a black dot.

While the orchestration of data acquisition is performed by {targets}, a workflow management program for R, all code directly related to GEE data acquisition is written in Python. 3.1 {reticulate} Conda Environment RStudio (Posit team 2023) is an IDE that, alongside the {reticulate} package (Ushey, Allaire, and Tang 2023), facilitates integration of R and Python code within the same environment. In lakeSR, we use a singular R script to set up a {reticulate} Conda environment that is invoked at the beginning of a {targets} run (lines 8-12 of the _targets.R file) to be sure that our Python code runs consistently.

(2020) The script run_targets.Rmd includes the steps to create this environment and authenticate your GEE user. These steps should be run prior to running the pipeline to assure a smooth run of the workflow. 3.2 Google Earth Engine Setup 3.2.1 Create a GEE account Creation of a GEE is easy and free. Click ‘Get Started’ at the far right side of the earthengine.google.com webpage to create an account: 3.2.2 gcloud CLI This workflow requires the installation and initiation of gcloud CLI, a command-line tool set for accessing Google Cloud Resources. All settings for lakeSR and siteSR are default gcloud configurations using a singular GEE project. 3.2.3 GEE Authentication Once gcloud is installed and initialized and the Conda environment is set up, you can authenticate your GEE instance. For this workflow, this is completed in the run_targets.Rmd script at the root directory. This script provides explicit directions to complete this task before running the pipeline. 3.2.4 GEE project setting lakeSR is run in a specific GEE project associated with our authenticated account. If you wish to re-run this code as written, you will not have proper access because the code refers to our specific GEE project. You will need to update the config yaml (b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config_poi.yml) with your Google credentials and GEE project in order to run this locally. A blank yml file (b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config.yml) is provided for further customization. If you are new to GEE, go to code.earthengine.google.com and enter the project name listed in the top right hand corner of your screen: Alternatively, you can create an GEE project for this task in the dropdown menu accessed by clicking on the icon to the right of the highlighted box in the figure above. This workflow will not run without specifying an Earth Engine Project that is managed by the Google Account you authenticate this run with. References Fajardo, Otto. 2023.

The Landsat archive of multispectral and thermal data in lakeSR is composed of Landsat missions 4 through 9 and spans more than 40 years.

Landsat 6 did not achieve orbit. For the purposes of lakeSR, we truncate the data record for Landsat 4 and 5 at the end of the Science Mission of the satellite. Landsat 7 began to experience orbital drift beginning in 2017, resulting in top-of-atmosphere (and therefore also surface reflectance data) that had growing uncertainties over time as the drift increased (Qiu et al. 2021). Qui (2021) suggests that data are not robust enough for trend analysis after the start of the growing season in 2020, but because their analysis was of NDVI, we conservatively truncated the data at the end of 2019. 4.1.1 Spectral Response While the nominal bands for each of the missions within the archive is relatively consistent (with the addition of an Aerosol band beginning Landsat 8), the precise spectral response for each nominal band shifted beginning with Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS: Se nsors Ae rosol Blue Green Red Near Inf rared (NIR) Short Wave Inf rared 1 (SWIR 1) Short Wave Inf rared 2 (SWIR 2) Th ermal TM ETM+ N/A 0.45 -0.52 μm 0.52 -0.60 μm 0.63 -0.69 μm 0.77 -0.90 μm 1.55 -1.75 μm 2.08 -2.35 μm 1 0.40- 12.50 μm OL I /TIRS O LI-2/ T IRS-2 0 .435- 0.451 μm 0 .452- 0.512 μm 0 .533- 0.590 μm 0 .636- 0.673 μm 0 .851- 0.879 μm 1 .566- 1.651 μm 2 .107- 2.294 μm 10 .60-1 1.19, 1 1.50- 12.51 μm 4.1.2 Sensor Resolution The spatial resolution of the Level 1 data has not changed for optical bands (Aerosol, RGB, NIR, SWIR) but has varied over the history for thermal data: Sensors Optical Bands Thermal Bands TM 30 120 ETM+ 30 60 OLI/TIRS OLI-2/TIRS-2 30 100 All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have been resampled to 30m in the USGS SRST product. Alongside the pixel resolution of the sensors is the radiometric resolution at which the data are stored. TM and ETM+ data are stored as 8-bit data products, OLI data are quantitized to 12 bits and Landsat 9 to 14 bits. This equates to 256 shades per band for Landsat 4-7, 4,096 shades for Landsat 8 and 16,384 shades for Landsat 9, where higher numbers allow for greater precision of measurement in a given band. All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have been rescaled to 16 bits. 4.2 Surface Reflectance Product The information presented in this section originates from the USGS Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR. The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance (SR) product is a Level 2 data product that has been atmospherically corrected from the Level 1 Top of Atmosphere product using a myriad of inputs to create a reasonably consistent data product across space and time. The USGS EROS describes the SR product as follows: Surface reflectance improves comparison between multiple images over the same region by accounting for atmospheric effects such as aerosol scattering and thin clouds, which can help in the detection and characterization of Earth surface change. Surface reflectance is generated from Level-1 inputs that meet the &lt;76 degrees Solar Zenith Angle constraint and include the required auxiliary data inputs to generate a scientifically viable product. 4.2.1 SR Atmospheric Processing The SR product for Landsat 4-7 is calculated using the Land Ecosystem Distrubance Adaptive Procesing System (LEDAPS) (Schmidt et al. 2013) and Landsat 8 and 9 SR data are calculated using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) algorithm (Vermote et al. 2018). The two algorithms are functionally different, but the outcome is the same: a consistently-processed surface reflectance product that is available worldwide. See the table under section heading ‘Differences in Surface Reflectance Processing Algorithms’ on the USGS Landsat C2 website for details. 4.3 Surface Temperature The information presented in this section originates from the USGS Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR. The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature (ST) product is calculated using a single-channel algorithm (M. J. Cook 2014; M. Cook et al. 2014) to convert the thermal band data to temperature estimates in degrees Kelvin. These data are considered interoperable over space and time with few differences in the ST algorithm product within Collection 2, with the acknowledgement of the previously-documented spectral and radiometric resolution differences.

This data product contains “full stacks” of the Landsat Collection 2 record - that is, all summarized Landsat data available from all Landsat missions that met our QA criteria. 5.1 Overview The workflow for data acquisition is as follows: read in and format the yaml configuration file for the GEE run (b_config_file_poi, b_yml_poi) reformat the locations file for the GEE run using the configuration file (b_ref_locations_poi) determine the WRS-2 path-rows that intersect with the locations file (b_WRS_pathrow_poi) filter the locations for those that are completely contained by the WRS-2 path-row when the automated buffer is added, add the WRS-2 path-rows to the reformatted locations, and save distinct location files by path-row for easier processing in Python (b_poi_locs_filtered) iteratively run the GEE script per WRS-2 path-row (b_eeRun_poi) check to see that all tasks are complete in GEE before moving to next step (b_poi_tasks_complete) check to see if any tasks failed in GEE extraction which is not visible from the RStudio IDE (b_check_for_failed_tasks) 5.2 Technical Implementation of Acquisition Script In order to cue Python scripts and map along WRS-2 path-rows within the {targets} architecture, we use a function (run_GEE_per_pathrow()) which writes the current WRS-2 path-row to a text file, then sources a python script that uses that text file to run the acquisition for the path-row. Additional details are provided below to describe the steps in the python script (run_GEE_per_pathrow.py). 5.2.1 Custom Functions The first section of run_GEE_per_pathrow.py saves custom functions used in the Landsat stack acquisition. These include data manipulation to create Earth Engine (EE) objects, custom QA masks, DSWE algorithm, and the functions that perform the masking and extraction of data from the Landsat image. Below is an overview of some of the custom masking procedures and their justification, if available. apply_rad_mask: Masks out all pixels that are radiometrically saturated in any optical band using the QA_RADSAT QA band apply_cf_mask: Applies mask for any pixels obstructed by clouds and snow/ice using the CLOUD_QA band apply_sr_aero_mask: Applies mask for any pixels in Landsat 8 and 9 that have ‘medium’ or ‘high’ aerosol QA flags from the SR_QA_AEROSOL band apply_opac_mask: Applies mask to remove pixels where atmospheric opacity is greater than 0.3 in Landsat 4, 5, and 7 using the SR_ATMOS_OPACITY band apply_fill_mask_457 and apply_fill_mask_89: Applies a mask where any band value is 0 before applying scaling factors to bands apply_realistic_mask_457 and apply_realistic_mask_89: Applies a mask where any band is less than -0.01 after scaling, indicating overcorrection of SR product 5.2.2 Defining water area DSWE: Calculates the dynamic surface water extent per pixel, as defined by Jones (2019) and US Geological Survey (n.d.a), within the scope of lakeSR we extract DSWE 1 and what we refer to as DSWE1a, described later. a value of 0 indicates no water/fill 1 is confident water 2 is low confidence water 3 is high confidence partial water (or vegetated water) 4 is low confidence partial water These functions are 5.2.3 Setup The first 50 lines of the run_GEE_per_pathrow.py file import Python modules (lines 2-8), read in the formatted configuration file (line 11) and assign environment variables (lines 13-41), read in the text file that stores the current tile (lines 43-45) created by the run_GEE_per_tile() function called in the eeRun_poi target), and read in the locations file created in the target poi_locs_WRS_latlon then subset it for locations that are within the current tile (lines 47-50). 5.2.4 Collating Earth Engine objects for extraction The next section of code (lines 52-129) collates the Landsat stacks and formats them for data extraction. Each Earth Engine Image Collection (ee.ImageCollection in the script) for each Landsat mission is filtered for total cloud cover in the scene (CLOUD_COVER, set at &lt;90%), the date range of interest (all images until 2023-07-01), the current tile path and row value, and then unscaled from the digital number (DN) values that the data are stored in. Below is a code chunk as an example of this process for Landsat 7 (lines 61-66). Note that cloud_thresh, yml_start, yml_end are configuration settings, w_p and w_r represent the current path and row of the WRS-2 tile. l7 = (ee.ImageCollection(&quot;LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2&quot;) .filter(ee.Filter.lt(&quot;CLOUD_COVER&quot;, ee.Number.parse(str(cloud_thresh)))) .filter(ee.Filter.eq(&quot;WRS_PATH&quot;, w_p)) .filter(ee.Filter.eq(&quot;WRS_ROW&quot;, w_r)) .filterDate(yml_start, yml_end) .map(apply_scale_factors)) The function apply_scale_factors() is a prescribed function which is consistent across all Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 SR and ST products to transform the DN to remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values with the following function: def apply_scale_factors(image): &quot;&quot;&quot; Applies scaling factors for Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance and surface temperature products Args: image: one ee.Image of an ee.ImageCollection Returns: ee.Image with band values overwritten by scaling factors &quot;&quot;&quot; opticalBands = image.select(&quot;SR_B.&quot;).multiply(0.0000275).add(-0.2) thermalBands = image.select(&quot;ST_B.*&quot;).multiply(0.00341802).add(149.0) return image.addBands(opticalBands, None, True).addBands(thermalBands, None,True) The resulting Landsat 4-7 collections are collated into a single ee.ImageCollection (line 81), and bands are renamed for continuity (lines 83-96). The same is done for Landsat 8 and 9 (lines 99-129). These two ee.ImageCollections are handled separately, as the pixel-level metadata within the scenes from these missions is slightly different and processing must be completed separately. 5.2.5 Payload handling Because GEE is a free service to those at academic or governmental institutions, there are limits to the total size of a task sent to GEE for completion. For this reason, tasks are sent to GEE in 10k location increments per tile (for-loop encompassing lines 132-321). This is an additional step that is taken in addition to processing per tile to avoid failed tasks. 5.3 Changes from AquaSat v1 References Jones, John W. 2019. “Improved Automated Detection of Subpixel-Scale Inundationrevised Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) Partial Surface Water Tests.” Remote Sensing 11 (4). https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11040374.
