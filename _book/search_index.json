The data acquired at locations where there are in situ data are acquired to create location-specific algorithms using the AquaMatch database, which can then be applied to the data collected over the centrally-located point across all waterbodies in the lakeSR database. lakeSR does not acquire nor summarize data over the entire waterbody’s surface, as it is computationally impractical for most large lakes that cross multiple satellite path-rows or tiles. We are planning to investigate the variability differences in acquiring data over varying buffer distances to support this decision (GitHub Issue #14). At this time, the buffer used is a 120m radius of any given data acquisition location. 2.1 Pole of Inaccessibility The concept of “pole of inaccessibility” (POI) (Stefansson 1920) is used to define the geographic center of a circle with the largest circumference within any complex polygon. The foundational principle is used widely to describe the arctic pole of inaccessiblity, that is the point in the northern arctic circle that is the furthest from land, but has also been used to describe the geographic center of landmasses (Garcia-Castellanos and Lombardo 2007). For lakeSR, we use POI to determine the point in a lake that is furthest from the shoreline using the polylabelr::poi() function (Larsson 2020), which calculates a point in space and the radius of the circle used to define the POI. 2.2 Lakes included in lakeSR For lakeSR, we use the NHDPlusHR dataset for lakes within the conterminous US and US Territories using the nhdplusTools::download_nhdplushr() function (Blodgett and Johnson 2023). All HUC4s were downloaded and processed on 2023-10-05 using the most updated version available at the time of download. Because the NHDPlusHR dataset is incomplete for Alaska (Figure 2.1), we used the NHD Best Resolution File for the state of AK (US Geological Survey, n.d.). Figure 2.1: NHDPlusHR dataset availability, courtesy of the USGS. For every HUC4 included in the NHDPlusHR dataset and the state of Alaska NHD Best Resolution dataset, all waterbodies are limited to those with FCodes belonging to the following groups: 390 (lake/pond), 436 (reservoir), and 361 (playa) and are at least 0.01 km2 (1 hectare) in area according to the area value provided in the NHD file. This filtering resulted in 1,135,312 waterbodies included in our dataset, including 415,008 from Alaska. For each waterbody, the POI and distance-to-shore radius was calculated using the polylabelr::poi() function. In order to accurately calculate distance-to-shore, each waterbody was converted to the proper Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection calculated from the mean longitudinal value of the polygon vertices prior to applying the poi() function. By using the point-local UTM projection, we decrease distortion expected from any single CRS used to represent all of the locations from which we have lakes. The latitude and longitude values of the POI were transformed to decimal degrees in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) (EPSG:4326) from UTM easting and northing coordinates for use later in the workflow. It is important to note that the poi() function does not perform particularly well on larger polygons, however the points calculated should be an acceptable proxy for pelagic lake conditions. [[Will add additional detail from analysis of buffer sizes.]] 2.3 Implementation The code for gathering NHD waterbodies and calculating their respective POIs is found in {targets} group a_Calculate_Centers which is located in the script a_Calculate_Centers.R. The network graph (Figure 2.2) for this group depicts the dependencies between each of the targets in this group. Figure 2.2: Network graph of the targets in the a_Calculate_Centers {targets} group. On a high level, the processing begins by acquiring the polygons of all US states and territories using the {tigris} package (Walker 2023) (US_state_territories). These polygons are used to acquire a list HUC4s that intersect with each municipal boundary using the nhdplusTools::get_huc() function (HUC4_dataframe), which are then reduced to distinct HUC4’s and transformed into a vector of HUC4s (HUC4_list). As an error-handling measure, empty_hucs_file is created (not pictured in Figure 2.2) to collect a list of HUC4s that do not have high resolution files available for download (Figure 2.1). The target all_poi_points is created by calculating POIs for all waterbodies &gt; 1 hectare and having an FCode of 390, 436, or 361 from each HUC4 in the HUC4_list. For this target, we use the dynamic branching feature to iterate over each item in the HUC4_list. See the script calculate_centers_HUC4.R for details on the function applied in this target. The output of the all_poi_points target include multiple .csv files - these files are collated in the target all_poi_points, which outputs a .feather file (tracked as NHDHR_poi_points) containing all the POIs resulting from the NHDPlusHR polygon files. The NHDPlusHR contains a small number of sub-HUC4 waterbodies (specifically a few HUC8’s and HUC10’s) in the state of AK, but to make processing more straightforward, POIs from polygons from the NHDPlusHR that were from these files were removed (NHD_poi_points_noAK). The target make_AK_poi_points downloads the NHD Best Resolution geopackage and calculates POIs for each waterbody polygon of the same size and type as stated previously. (See the script calculate_AK_poi.R) The resulting file (tracked as AK_poi_points), is combined with the NHD_poi_points_noAK target to create a harmonized and collated file in the target combined_poi_file (see collate_NHDHR_AK.R, the output file istracked as combined_poi_points).
