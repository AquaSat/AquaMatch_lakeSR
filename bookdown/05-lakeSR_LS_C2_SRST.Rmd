# lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST Data Product {#LS-C2-SRST}

The **lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST** data product is a set of tabular datasets,
representing either the SR and ST data summarized for the POI location which is
meant to represent pelagic conditions at a given waterbody (identified by its
NHD Permanent Identifier, see Section \@ref(locs-data-acq)) or representing the
SR and ST data summarized for any sampling location(s) within a waterbody
detected in the WQP in the early stages of **AquaMatch**. Both types of data
contain "full stacks" of the Landsat Collection 2 record - that is, all
summarized Landsat data available from all Landsat missions.

## Overview

At a high level, the workflow for data acquisition is as follows:

1.  read in and format the yaml configuration file for the GEE run

    -   for POI: completed in `config_file_poi`, `yml_file_poi`, `yml_poi`

2.  reformat the locations file for the GEE run using the configuration file

    -   for POI: completed in `ref_locs_poi_file`, `ref_locations_poi`

3.  determine the WRS-2 path rows (or 'tiles') that intersect with the locations
    file

    -   for POI: completed in `WRS_tiles_poi`

4.  add the WRS-2 path rows to the reformatted locations file for quicker
    processing

    -   for POI: completed in `poi_locs_WRS_file`, `poi_locs_WRS`,
        `poi_locs_WRS_latlon`

5.  iteratively run the GEE script per WRS-2 tile

    -   for POI: completed in `eeRun_poi`

6.  check to see that all tasks are complete in GEE before moving to next step

    -   for POI: completed in `poi_tasks_complete`

```{r b-group-vis, fig.cap= "Network graph of the *targets* in the b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi {targets} group."}
 with_dir("..", {
    tar_visnetwork(targets_only = T, 
                   shortcut = T,
                   label = "branches",
                   names = c("yml_file_poi",
                             "yml_poi_file",
                             "yml_poi",
                             "yml_poi", 
                             "ref_locs_poi_file",
                             "ref_locations_poi",
                             "WRS_tiles_poi",
                             "poi_locs_WRS_file",
                             "poi_locs_with_WRS",
                             "poi_locs_WRS_latlon",
                             "eeRun_poi",
                             "poi_tasks_complete"))
    })
```

## Data Acquisition Script

The data acquisition pipeline for POIs and sampling locations for the
**lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST** data product is the same, but the pipeline is initialized
with two different yaml configuration files. This section will walk through the
code in `b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/py/runGEEperTile.py`.

### Setup

The first 50 lines of the `runGEEperTile.py` file import Python modules (lines
2-8), read in the formatted configuration file (line 11) and assign environment
variables (lines 13-41), read in the text file that stores the current tile
(lines 43-45) created by the `run_GEE_per_tile()` function called in the
`eeRun_poi` target), and read in the locations file created in the target
`poi_locs_WRS_latlon` then subset it for locations that are within the current
tile (lines 47-50).

### Collating Earth Engine objects for extraction 

The next section of code (lines 52-129) collates the Landsat stacks and formats
them for data extraction.

Each Earth Engine Image Collection (`ee.ImageCollection` in the script) for each
Landsat mission is filtered for total cloud cover in the scene (`CLOUD_COVER`,
set at \<90%), the date range of interest (all images until 2023-07-01), the
current `tile` path and row value, and then unscaled from the digital number
(DN) values that the data are stored in. Below is a code chunk as an example of
this process for Landsat 7 (lines 61-66). Note that `cloud_thresh`, `yml_start`,
`yml_end` are configuration settings, `w_p` and `w_r` represent the current
*path* and *row* of the WRS-2 tile.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
l7 = (ee.ImageCollection("LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2")
    .filter(ee.Filter.lt("CLOUD_COVER", ee.Number.parse(str(cloud_thresh))))
    .filterDate(yml_start, yml_end)
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq("WRS_PATH", w_p))
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq("WRS_ROW", w_r))
    .map(apply_scale_factors))
```

The function `apply_scale_factors()` is a prescribed function which is
consistent across all Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 SR and ST products to
transform the DN to remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values with the following
function:

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
def apply_scale_factors(image):
  """ Applies scaling factors for Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance 
  and surface temperature products

  Args:
      image: one ee.Image of an ee.ImageCollection

  Returns:
      ee.Image with band values overwritten by scaling factors
  """
  opticalBands = image.select("SR_B.").multiply(0.0000275).add(-0.2)
  thermalBands = image.select("ST_B.*").multiply(0.00341802).add(149.0)
  return image.addBands(opticalBands, None, True).addBands(thermalBands, None,True)
```

The resulting Landsat 4-7 collections are collated into a single
ee.ImageCollection (line 81), and bands are renamed for continuity (lines
83-96). The same is done for Landsat 8 and 9 (lines 99-129). These two
ee.ImageCollections are handled separately, as the pixel-level metadata within
the scenes from these missions is slightly different and processing must be
completed separately.

### Payload handling

Because GEE is a free service, there are limits to the total size of a task sent
to GEE for completion. For this reason, tasks are sent to GEE in 10k location
increments per tile (for-loop encompassing lines 132-321). This is an additional
step that is taken in addition to processing per tile to avoid failed tasks.
