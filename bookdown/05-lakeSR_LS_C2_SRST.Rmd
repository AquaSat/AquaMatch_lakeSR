# lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST Data Product {#LS-C2-SRST}

The **lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST** data product is a set of tabular datasets,
representing either the SR and ST data summarized for the POI location which is
meant to represent pelagic conditions at a given waterbody (identified by its
NHD Permanent Identifier, see Section \@ref(locs-data-acq)) or representing the
SR and ST data summarized for any sampling location(s) within a waterbody
detected in the WQP in the early stages of **AquaMatch**. Both types of data
contain "full stacks" of the Landsat Collection 2 record - that is, all
summarized Landsat data available from all Landsat missions.

## Overview

At a high level, the workflow for data acquisition is as follows:

1.  read in and format the yaml configuration file for the GEE run

    -   for POI: completed in `config_file_poi`, `yml_file_poi`, `yml_poi`

2.  reformat the locations file for the GEE run

    -   for POI: completed in `ref_locs_poi_file`, `ref_locations_poi`

3.  determine the WRS-2 path rows (or 'tiles') that intersect with the locations
    file

    -   for POI: completed in `WRS_tiles_poi`

4.  add the WRS-2 path rows to the reformatted locations file for quicker
    processing

    -   for POI: completed in `poi_locs_WRS_file`, `poi_locs_WRS`,
        `poi_locs_WRS_latlon`

5.  iteratively run the GEE script per WRS-2 tile

    -   for POI: completed in `eeRun_poi`

6.  check to see that all tasks are complete in GEE before moving to next step

    -   for POI: completed in `poi_tasks_complete`

  tar_visnetwork(targets_only = T, 
                 shortcut = T,
                 label = "branches",
                 names = c("yml_file_poi",
                           "yml_poi_file",
                           "yml_poi",
                           "yml_poi", 
                           "ref_locs_poi_file",
                           "ref_locations_poi",
                           "WRS_tiles_poi",
                           "poi_locs_WRS_file",
                           "poi_locs_with_WRS",
                           "poi_locs_WRS_latlon",
                           "eeRun_poi",
                           "poi_tasks_complete"))
  })
```

## Data Acquisition Script

The data acquisition pipeline for POIs and sampling locations for the
**lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST** data product is the same, but the pipeline is initialized
with two different yaml configuration files. This section will walk through the
code in `b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/py/runGEEperTile.py` and the functions called
in that code which are stored in `b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/py/GEE_functions.py`.
