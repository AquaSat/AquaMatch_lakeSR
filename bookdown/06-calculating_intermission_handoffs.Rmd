# Calculating Intermission Handoffs {#handoff}

It is necessary to standardize band values between Landsat missions in order to
create a robust timeseries. @maciel2023 notes the issues in using the Landsat
Surface Reflectance product as a timeseries without careful handling of data
between missions. This standardization process attempts to address changes in
sensor spectral response and atmospheric correction procedures. For the purposes
of AquaSat v2, we call this standardization process "intermission handoffs".
Intermission handoffs are defined by the data obtained in the overlapping period
of time between two adjacent-in-time missions (details provided in Section
\@ref(define-handoff). In AquaSat v2, we standardize values relative to Landsat
7 (`corr7`) and Landsat 8 (`corr8`). The Landsat 7 intermission handoffs can be
applied the entire Landsat 4-9 because it overlapped with early Landsat (4/5)
and modern Landsat (8/9). For the `corr7` standardization, we treat Landsat 4
and 5 as interchangable, given that the satellites contained the same payload
and radiometric resolution. We also treat Landsat 8 and 9 as interchangable
despite the slight differences in spectral response and radiometric resolution.
Landsat 8 handoffs (`corr8`) can only be applied to Landsat 7 and 9 due to
mission overlap, so the standardized data timeseries is shorter; however, it may
be more robust for analyses focused in the recent past that rely on Landsat 9
data given the previously-mentioned caveats for application of `corr7` to that
mission.

## Raw lakeSR stacks {#raw-lakesr}

The data exported from the GEE tasks described in Section \@ref(LS-SRST-pull)
were collated into large .feather files per DSWE type (DSWE1 and DSWE1a) and per
Landsat mission. These files are stored in Google Drive for posterity and to add
functionality to this workflow. The Google Drive ids can be found at the file
path `c_collate_Landsat_data/out/` and can be accessed without special
permissions by downstream users. Many of these files are quite large (on the
order of many GBs) and are very difficult to handle outside of a programming or
database environment. We provide these files for advanced users who wish to make
changes to the QAQC or intermission handoff procedures.

## Calculating handoffs {#define-handoff}

We follow the practice described in @gardner2021 to calculate intermission
handoffs, where all band values during the period of overlap between two
missions (e.g. 1999-04-15 through 2011-11-18 for Landsat 5 and 7 - see Section
\@ref(valid-dates)) are considered. These data are summarized to each mission's
1st-99th percentile value per band, and the handoff coefficients between
missions are defined by the second-order polynomial relationship between them.
Because we use a second-order polynomial, all values outside of the 1st and 99th
percentile values used to define the intermission handoff are flagged and should
be used with extreme caution. All `corr7` and `corr8` relationships and their
derived coefficients are provided in the sections below.
