# Background

Currently, AquaMatch remote sensing products contain data from the historical
Landsat Collection 2 record from 1984 until late 2024, including the following
missions:

-   Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM)
-   Landsat 5 TM
-   Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)
-   Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS)
-   Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS

**WARNING: the Landsat Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature products
should not be used without applying a handoff coefficient to harmonize data
between missions.** See Section \@ref(define-handoff) for details on this
process.

There will be additional satellite data incorporated into AquaMatch in the
future.

## lakeSR Code Architecture

[lakeSR code](https://github.com/AquaSat/AquaMatch_lakeSR) is broken down into
groups of targets that perform specific tasks, listed below with a brief summary
about what task(s) each group completes. This particular workflow incorporates
both R and Python programming languages to complete these tasks.

The lakeSR folder structure is as follows:

### Configuration Files

**config.yml:**

lakeSR relies on this general configuration file to run specific profiles that
determine what operations are being run. The file contains two configuration
profiles: "default" and "admin_update".

-   "default" uses publicly-posted stable versions of datasets from
    AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP and is intended for those who wish to modify choices
    made after Landsat stacks are acquired (e.g. baseline quality assurance
    filters {targets} group -d- and calculation of handoff coefficients group
    -e-). By default, the bookdown is not rendered in this option, as changes to
    the pipeline may require non-automated changes to the text of the bookdown.

-   "admin_update" is intended for use by ROSSyndicate members when updating
    lakeSR datasets and by by default creates publicly-stable versions of the
    lakeSR dataset in Google Drive, and the Drive file ids are stored in the
    AquaMatch_lakeSR repository for external users. This configuration could
    also be used by others to re-run the pipeline and wish to make changes to
    the site location calculations ({targets} group -a-) or GEE implementation
    ({targets} group -b-) and collation ({targets} group -c-). By default, the
    bookdown is rendered in this option, but keep in mind not all changes
    implemented are not automatically reflected in the bookdown.

Advanced users are welcome to adapt the pipeline to incorporate other masks or
filters or to incorporate other quality assurance filters or handoff methods.

**b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_poi.yml**:

This configuration file defines parameters of the GEE pull. This configuration
can be customized. To create a different configuration of the GEE pull, fill out
the yaml file at the file path `b_pull_Landast_SRST_poi/config_poi.yml`. If you
change the name of this file, you will need to update the file name at line 32
of the `_targets.R` file.

### {targets} groups

**a_Calculate_Centers**:

For all lakes, we aggregate remotely-sensed data via a central location with a
buffer instead of the entire lake area to reduce processing time and the
downstream impacts of lakes whose surface crosses WRS2 path-row boundaries. This
{targets} list calculates "Pole of Inaccessibility" (POI)
[@garcia-castellanos2007] for all non-intermittent lakes, ponds, and reservoirs
greater than 1 hectare in surface area and intermittent lakes, ponds, and
reservoirs greater than 4 hectares using the NHDPlusV2 polygons using the
{nhdplusTools} package [@blodgett2023], NHD Best Resolution files for non-CONUS
waterbodies, and the `poi()` function in the {polylabelr} package
[@larsson2020].

See Section \@ref(locs-data-acq) for additional background and detailed
methodology.

This group is either run completely or pulled from existing files based on
lakeSR general configuration file using the boolean `calculate_centers` setting.
If set to `FALSE` a version date must be provided in the `centers_version`
setting. Additional guidance is provided in the README and general configuration
file of the lakeSR repository.

**b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi**:

This {targets} group uses the configuration file
`b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config_poi.yml` and the "Pole of
Inaccessibility" points created in the `a_Calculate_Centers` group to pull
Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature using the
Google Earth Engine (GEE) API. In this group, we use the most conservative LS4-7
pixel filters, as we are applying these settings across such a large continuum
of time and space. This group ends with a branched target that sends tasks to
Google Earth engine by mapping over WRS2 path rows that intersect with the
points created in the `a_Calculate_Centers` group.

**Note**: this group of targets takes a very long time, running 2 minutes - 1
hour per path-row branch in `b_eeRun_poi`. There are just under 800 path rows
executed in this target. Anecdotally speaking, processing time is often defined
by the number of queued tasks globally, so weekends and nights are often periods
of quicker processing than weekday during business hours. As written for data
publication, run time is 7-10 days.

See Section \@ref(software-settings) for details on software used in this
workflow, Section \@ref(LS-C2-SRST) for additional background on Landsat data,
and Section \@ref(LS-SRST-pull) for detailed methodology of the Landsat pull.

This group is either run completely or pulled from existing files based on
lakeSR general configuration file using the boolean `run_GEE` setting. If set to
`FALSE` a version date must be provided in the `collated_version` setting.
Additional guidance is provided in the README and general configuration file of
the lakeSR repository.

**c_collate_Landsat_data:**

This {targets} list collates the data from the Google Earth Engine run
orchestrated in the {targets} group `b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi` and creates
publicly-available files for downstream use, storing a dataframe of Drive ids in
a .csv in the `c_collate_Landsat_data/out/` folder.

This group is either run completely or pulled from existing files based on
lakeSR general configuration file using the boolean `run_GEE` setting. If set to
`FALSE` a version date must be provided in the `collated_version` setting.
Additional guidance is provided in the README and general configuration file of
the lakeSR repository.

**d_qa_filter_sort:**

This {targets} list applies some rudimentary QA to the Landsat stacks and saves
them as sorted files locally. LS 4/9 are complete .csv files, LS 578 are broken
up by HUC2 for memory and space considerations. If `update_and_share` is set to
TRUE, the workflow will send dated, publicly available files to Google Drive and
save Drive file information in the `d_qa_filter_sort/out/` folder. If set to
FALSE, no files will be sent to Drive.

See Section \@ref(post-hoc-qa) for detailed methodology of this portion of the
workflow.

**e_caclculate_handoffs:**

This {targets} group creates "matched" data for two different "intermission
handoff" methods that standardize the SR values relative to LS7 and to LS8.
Handoffs are visualized and are saved as tables for use downstream in this
group. Corrections are calculated for all neighboring missions, even if not
explicitly used downstream (e.g. LS 4/5 and LS 8/9).

See Section \@ref(define-handoff) for detailed methodology of this portion of
the workflow.

**y_siteSR_targets:**

This {targets} group pulls information from the siteSR workflow to use in the
bookdown. If the configuration setting `update_bookown` is set to FALSE, this
list will be empty.

**z_render_bookdown:**

This {targets} group tracks chapters of the bookdown for changes and renders the
bookdown. If the configuration setting `update_bookown` is set to FALSE, this
list will be empty.

## siteSR Code Architecture

[siteSR code](https://github.com/AquaSat/AquaMatch_siteSR_WQP) retrieves WQP
sites using `dataRetrieval::whatWQPsites()`, NWIS sites using
`dataRetrieval::whatNWISsites()`, and any remaining WQP sites at which there are
historical *in situ* data from the [AquaMatch harmonization
pipeline](https://github.com/AquaSat/AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP). lakeSR provides
calculated Landsat intermission handoff coefficients for interoperability
between sensors (see Section \@ref(define-handoff)).

The siteSR folder structure is as follows:

### Configuration Files {#setup-description}

**config.yml:**

siteSR_WQP relies on this configuration file to run specific profiles that
determine what operations are being run. The file provides two configuration
profiles: "default" and "admin_update".

-   "default" runs the pipeline using archived versions of datasets made with
    specific {targets} groups within this workflow. In this setting, {targets}
    groups -a- (collating locations from WQP, NWIS, and AquaMatch harmonization
    pipeline), -b- (determining remote sensing visibility), and -c- (pulling the
    Landsat record from GEE) are not run, but rather archived files are pulled
    in to reduce run time.

-   "admin_update" is intended for use by ROSSyndicate members when updating
    siteSR datasets and by default creates publicly-stable versions of the
    siteSR dataset in Google Drive, and the Drive file ids are stored in the
    AquaMatch_siteSR repository for external users. This configuration could
    also be used by others to re-run the pipeline and wish to make changes to
    the site location collation ({targets} group -a-), remote sensing visibility
    thresholds ({targets} group -b-) or GEE implementation ({targets} group
    -c-).

Proper configuration of `harmonize_repo_directory` is imperative as the siteSR
workflow references files inside AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP file structure. If this
is incorrectly set up, users will receive a message to communicate this. All
repositories stored on the AquaMatch GitHub will contain files that link to
versions of the data that the AquaMatch team has harmonized so that a local run
is not necessitated.

**gee_config.yml**:

This configuration file defines parameters of the GEE pull. This configuration
can be customized. To create a different configuration of the GEE pull, fill out
the yaml file at the file path `gee_config.yml`. If you change the name of this
file, you will need to update the file name at line 9 of the
`b_determine_RS_visibility.R` script.

### {targets} Groups

**\_targets.R:**

This initial group of targets checks the configuration settings in config.yml,
checks for the harmonization pipeline and for proper Google Drive folder
architecture. This group also acquires target objects from the harmonization
pipeline.

**a_compile_sites:**

This {targets} group collates the sites from the WQP, NWIS, and the AquaMatch
harmonization pipeline, creating a list of locations to acquire remote sensing
data. All locations are associated with a HUC8 if one is not listed in the
metadata for the site from the WQP, then the unique HUC4s are used to associate
points with waterbodies and flowlines of the NHDPlusV2 (CONUS) or NHD Best
Resolution (non-CONUS HUCs) files where HUC8.

**b_determine_RS_visibility:**

The resulting list of *in situ* locations are used to assess remote-sensing
visibility in this {targets} group. Sites are assessed for visibility using the
JRC Global Surface Water [@pekel2016] which is based on the historical Landsat
record. This {targets} group takes a number of hours to run, if the
configuration of `run_pekel` is set to TRUE. If the configuration is set to
FALSE, run time will be dependent on your internet connection (to access the
previously-created files) and the number of cores available to run the workflow.

**c_siteSR_stack:**

This group of {targets} acquires Landsat Collection 2 SRST stacks for sites
determined to be visible in the previous {targets} group. Data are collated in
this step. This {targets} group takes about three days to run, if the
configuration `run_GEE` is set to TRUE. If the configuration is set to FALSE,
run time will be dependent on your internet connection (to access the
previously-created files) and the number of cores available to run the workflow.

**d_siteSR_qa:**

Collated Landsat data are filtered for quality based on broadly applicable
thresholds and exported from the pipeline for data archiving. The resulting data
are archived in Google Drive and the Drive file ids area stored in this
repository for external access.
