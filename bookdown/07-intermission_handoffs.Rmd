It is necessary to standardize band values between Landsat missions in order to
create a robust timeseries. @maciel2023 notes the issues in using the Landsat
Surface Reflectance product for aquatic systems as a timeseries without careful
handling of data between missions. @king notes that this type of standardization
is necessary for the thermal band, as well. This standardization process
attempts to address changes in sensor spectral response and atmospheric
correction procedures. For the purposes of AquaMatch, we call this
standardization process "intermission handoffs". We implement two versions of
intermission handoffs: the method described in @roy2016 ("Roy method") and an
adapted version of that described in @gardner2021 ("Gardner method").

In AquaMatch, we provide coefficients to standardize remote sensing values
relative to Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. The Landsat 7 intermission handoffs create
a continuous record of remote sensing from Landsat 4 through 9 relative to
Landsat 7. This is because Landsat 4 and 5 and Landsat 8 and 9 can be treated as
interchangeable due to the similarity in sensor payload and radiometric
resolution. Data corrected to Landsat 8 relative values can only be applied to
Landsat 7 due to lack of mission overlap between Landsat 8 and Landsat 5, so the
resulting standardized data timeseries is shorter for any application of
correction relative to Landsat 8.

For the purposes of this document, we only present the handoff coefficients for
DSWE1 (confident water) and do not investigate differences between the DSWE1 or
DSWE1a coefficients, though we provide both. Users should use these handoff
coefficients if using data from more than one sensor group (TM, ETM+, OLI).

## Additional filtering applied

For the purposes of creating these handoff coefficients, we use flags created
when the locations were defined (see Section \@ref(lakeSR-shoreline)) and some
of the flags created in the GEE workflow (see Section \@ref(diagnostic-columns))
to use only the data we are most confident in when defining the handoff
coefficient. There are endless filters that can be applied prior to calculating
the handoff coefficients, but for the purposes of this document and data
product, we are somewhat conservative in filtering the data.

For optical bands, we removed data from sites where the `flag_optical_shoreline`
was 1 for this analysis (indicating that there is a possibility that the buffer
area includes mixed pixels). While we do use the DSWE-like algorithms to only
include confident water pixels, this is an effort to reduce impacts of
near-shore contamination in this process. Similarly, we removed the thermal band
data when the `flag_thermal_...` was 1, where the `...` represents the column
appropriate for the given mission, see Section \@ref(lakeSR-shoreline).
Additionally, we removed data from this process when there was any detected
cloud in the buffered area of the point (`prop_clouds` column), the metadata
file for the scene contained more than 50% cloud cover (`CLOUD_COVER` column),
and if either the `flag_temp_min` or `flag_temp_max` were 1. The thermal sensor
values can be dramatically impacted by clouds and we wanted to take a step to
reduce that carrying through this analysis.

## Roy method

The Roy method for calculating intermission handoffs uses paired images at
specific sites, where the reflectance data are obtained from two missions (e.g.
Landsat 7 and Landsat 8) separated by one day at a specific location within the
overlapping paths in the WRS2 path-row framework:

![An example of two overlapping WRS2 paths (grey area) separated by one day. Any
location with data for both images (in the grey area) would be considered a
paired data point to define the Roy method intermission
handoffs.](images/path_overlap_roy.png)

While @roy2016 implemented this method on a pixel-by-pixel basis, we implement
using the median band value per site where we have collected data in lakeSR,
available in the lakeSR remote sensing data summary files. This is used in place
of the explicit filters described in the Roy method (saturated pixels,
cloudy/snowy pixels, and pixels with value changes greater than the changes in
atmospheric correction), as we have implemented masks and QA filters to reduce
these sources of error. Handoff coefficients are defined by the ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression line or the Deming regression (MLE, assuming equal and
constant error in both x and y variables). Because Deming regression is
computationally intensive, the regression line is defined by a random sample of
10,000 matches. For the purposes of this documentation, we only include figures
and tables for the Deming regression (minimum likelihood estimation method) and
DSWE1. Intercepts and slopes for all handoffs are available at the file path
`e_calculate_handoffs/out/lakeSR_collated_handoffs_GEEv2025-02-12_QAv2025-06-04.csv`
and figures for all handoffs are created when the pipeline is run.

## Gardner method

Gardner method intermission handoffs are defined by the data obtained in the
overlapping period of time between two adjacent-in-time missions. These data are
filtered to sites that have at least one data point per year for at least 75% of
the years of overlap. The filtered data are then summarized to each mission's
1st-99th percentile value per band, and the handoff coefficients between
missions are defined by the second-order polynomial (quadratic) relationship
between them. Because this method uses a second-order polynomial to define the
handoff relationship, all input (x) values outside of the 1st and 99th
percentile values used to define the intermission handoff should be used with
extreme caution.

One additional consideration when using the Gardner method is, even when the
number of observations is high, if there is a difference between total
observations contributing to the quantile summaries, there may be systematic
differences built into the coefficients. An example of possible systematic
differences could be fewer observations from non-CONUS locations in Landsat 5
due to data transmission errors. We did not investigate the differences in
number of images listed in Table \@ref(tab:gardner-table) to determine what, if
any, systematic differences are present between the two missions. We provide the
Gardner method handoffs for continuity with the riverSR product for users who
would like that interoperability. As with the Roy, et al. method, intercepts and
slopes for all handoffs are available at the file path
`e_calculate_handoffs/out/lakeSR_collated_handoffs_GEEv2025-02-12_QAv2025-06-04.csv`
and figures for all handoffs are created when the pipeline is run.

## Implementing Roy Handoffs

Table \@ref(tab:roy-table) describes the number of matches contributing to the
intermission handoffs using the Roy method. We also include figures of the
OLS/MLE relationships and the residuals for the MLE corrections in addition to a
table of the coefficients for each DSWE1 MLE handoff.

Application of Roy-style handoffs is straightforward and is completed as simple
application of a linear equation:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

Where $b$ is the intercept, $m$ is the slope, $x$ is the band reflectance value
from the mission `Satellite to Correct` in Table \@ref(tab:roy-coeff-dem-corr7)
or \@ref(tab:roy-coeff-dem-corr8) and $y$ is the harmonized reflectance value
relative to the mission `Satellite to Harmonize to` in the previously-mentioned
tables. To reduce output data product size, we do not apply these handoffs
within the output data product, but rather provide users the tools to apply the
handoffs to the filtered lakeSR and siteSR data.

Application of Gardner-style handoffs is completed as simple application of a
second order polynomial equation:

$$
y = b0 + b1*x + b2*x^2
$$

Where $b0$ is the intercept, $b1$ is the coefficient of the $x$ value, $b2$ is
the coefficient of the quadratic term $x^2$, $x$ is the band reflectance value
from the mission `Satellite to Correct` in Table \@ref(tab:gard-coeff-corr7) or
\@ref(tab:gard-coeff-corr8) and $y$ is the harmonized reflectance value relative
to the mission `Satellite to Harmonize to` in the previously-mentioned tables.
To reduce output data product size, we do not apply these handoffs within the
output data product, but rather provide users the tools to apply the handoffs to
the filtered lakeSR and siteSR data.

### Gardner Correction Landsat 7 to Landsat 8

For each of the handoff figures below, the red line is the second order
polynomial regression and the grey dashed line is the 1:1 line. Coefficients for
the second order polynomial regression are provided in Table
\@ref(tab:gard-coeff-corr8). Color of dots represents the density of points in
at a given x, y location. In the residual plots, the grey dashed line is a 0
intercept, 0 slope line visual aide.
