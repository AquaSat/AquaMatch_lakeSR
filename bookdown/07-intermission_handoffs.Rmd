# Calculating intermission handoffs {#define-handoff}

It is necessary to standardize band values between Landsat missions in order to
create a robust timeseries. @maciel2023 notes the issues in using the Landsat
Surface Reflectance product as a timeseries without careful handling of data
between missions. @king notes that this type of standardization is necessary for
the thermal band, as well. This standardization process attempts to address
changes in sensor spectral response and atmospheric correction procedures. For
the purposes of AquaSat v2, we call this standardization process "intermission
handoffs". We implement two versions of intermission handoffs: the method
described in @roy2016 ("Roy method") and an adapted version of that described in
@gardner2021 ("Gardner method").

In AquaSat v2, we provide coefficients to standardize remote sensing values
relative to Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. The Landsat 7 intermission handoffs create
a continuous record of remote sensing from Landsat 4 through 9 relative to
Landsat 7 since Landsat 4 and 5 and Landsat 8 and 9 can be treated as
interchangeable due to the similarity in sensor payload and radiometric
resolution. Data corrected to Landsat 8 relative values can only be applied to
Landsat 7 due to lack of mission overlap between Landsat 8 and Landsat 5, so the
resulting standardized data timeseries.

For the purposes of this document, we only present the handoff coefficients for
DSWE1 (confident water) and do not investigate differences between the DSWE1 or
DSWE1a coefficients, though we provide both. Users should use these handoff
coefficients if using data from more than one sensor group (TM, ETM+, OLI).

## Roy method

The Roy method for calculating intermission handoffs uses paired images at
specific sites, where the reflectance data are obtained are from two missions
(e.g. Landsat 7 and Landsat 8) separated by one day at a specific location
within the overlapping paths in the WRS2 path-row framework:

![An example of two overlapping WRS2 paths (grey area) separated by one day. Any
location with data for both images (in the grey area) would be considered a
paired data point to define the Roy method intermission
handoffs.](images/path_overlap_roy.png)

While @roy2016 implemented this method on a pixel-by-pixel basis, we implement
using the median band value per site. This is used in place of the explicit
filters described in the Roy method (saturated pixels, cloudy/snowy pixels, and
pixels with value changes greater than the changes in atmospheric correction),
as we have implemented masks and QA filters to reduce these sources of error.
Handoff coefficients are defined by the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
line or the Deming regression (MLE, assuming equal and constant error in both x
and y variables). Because Deming regression is computationally intensive, the
regression line is defined by a random sample of 10,000 matches. For the
purposes of this documentation, we only include figures and tables for the
Deming regression (minimum likelihood estimation method) and DSWE1. Intercepts
and slopes for all handoffs are available at the file path
`e_calculate_handoffs/out/collated_handoffs_v2025-02-12.csv` and figures for all
handoffs are created when the pipeline is run.

## Gardner method

Gardner method intermission handoffs are defined by the data obtained in the
overlapping period of time between two adjacent-in-time missions. These data are
filtered to sites that have at least one data point per year for at least 75% of
the years of overlap. The filtered data are then summarized to each mission's
1st-99th percentile value per band, and the handoff coefficients between
missions are defined by the second-order polynomial (quadratic) relationship
between them. Because this method uses a second-order polynomial to define the
handoff relationship, all input (x) values outside of the 1st and 99th
percentile values used to define the intermission handoff should be used with
extreme caution.

One additional consideration when using the Gardner method is, even when the
number of observations are is high, if there is a difference between total
observations contributing to the quantile summaries, there may be systematic
differences built into the coefficients. An example of possible systematic
differences could be fewer observations from non-CONUS locations in Landsat 5
due to data transmission errors. We did not investigate the differences in n
listed in Table \@ref(tab:gardner-table) to determine what, if any, systematic
differences are present between the two missions. We provide the Gardner method
handoffs for continuity with the riverSR product for users who would like that
interoperability. As with the Roy, et al. method, intercepts and slopes for all
handoffs are available at the file path
`e_calculate_handoffs/out/collated_handoffs_v2025-02-12.csv` and figures for all
handoffs are created when the pipeline is run.

## Implementing Roy Handoffs

Table \@ref(tab:roy-table) describes the number of matches contributing to the
intermission handoffs using the Roy method. We also include figures of the
OLS/MLE relationships and the residuals for the MLE corrections in addition to a
table of the coefficients for each DSWE1 MLE handoff.

Application of Roy-style handoffs is straightforward and is completed as simple
application of a linear equation:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

Where $b$ is the intercept, $m$ is the slope, $x$ is the band reflectance value
from the mission `Satellite to Correct` in Table \@ref(tab:roy-coeff-dem-corr7)
or \@ref(tab:roy-coeff-dem-corr8) and $y$ is the harmonized reflectance value
relative to the mission `Satellite to Harmonize to` in the previously-mentioned
tables. To reduce output data product size, we do not apply these handoffs
within the output data product, but rather provide users the tools to apply the
handoffs to the filtered lakeSR and siteSR data.

Application of Gardner-style handoffs is completed as simple application of a
second order polynomial equation:

$$
y = b0 + b1*x + b2*x^2
$$

Where $b0$ is the intercept, $b1$ is the coefficient of the $x$ value, $b2$ is
the coefficient of the quadratic term $x^2$, $x$ is the band reflectance value
from the mission `Satellite to Correct` in Table \@ref(tab:gard-coeff-corr7) or
\@ref(tab:gard-coeff-corr8) and $y$ is the harmonized reflectance value relative
to the mission `Satellite to Harmonize to` in the previously-mentioned tables.
To reduce output data product size, we do not apply these handoffs within the
output data product, but rather provide users the tools to apply the handoffs to
the filtered lakeSR and siteSR data.
