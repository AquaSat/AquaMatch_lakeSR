# Locations of Data Acquisition

As noted in the Introduction (Section \@ref(introduction)), for the purposes of
**AquaSat**, surface reflectance and surface temperature data are acquired at
specific, centrally-located points within waterbodies (typically in pelagic
locations of lakes) and at locations where there are *in situ* data. The data
acquired at locations where there are *in situ* data are acquired to create
location-specific algorithms using the **AquaMatch** database, which can then be
applied to the data collected over the centrally-located point across all
waterbodies in the **lakeSR** database. **lakeSR** does not acquire nor
summarize data over the entire waterbody's surface, as it is computationally
impractical for most large lakes that cross multiple satellite path-rows or
tiles. We are planning to investigate the variability differences in acquiring
data over varying buffer distances to support this decision ([GitHub Issue
#14](https://github.com/rossyndicate/lakeSR/issues/14)). At this time, the
buffer used is a 120m radius of any given data acquisition location.

## Pole of Inaccessibility

The concept of "pole of inaccessibility" (POI) [@stefansson1920] is used to
define the geographic center of a circle with the largest circumference within
any complex polygon. The foundational principle is used widely to describe the
arctic pole of inaccessiblity, that is the point in the northern arctic circle
that is the furthest from land, but has also been used to describe the
geographic center of landmasses [@garcia-castellanos2007]. For **lakeSR**, we
use POI to determine the point in a lake that is furthest from the shoreline
using the `polylabelr::poi()` function [@larsson2020], which calculates a point
in space and the radius of the circle used to define the POI.

## Lakes included in lakeSR

For **lakeSR**, we use the [NHDPlusHR
dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution) for
lakes within the conterminous US and US Territories using the
`nhdplusTools::download_nhdplushr()` function [@blodgett2023]. All HUC4s were
downloaded and processed on
`r date(ymd_hms(file.info("../a_Calculate_Centers/mid/poi_centers_huc4_0101.csv")$mtime))`
using the most updated version available at the time of download. Because the
NHDPlusHR dataset is incomplete for Alaska (Figure \@ref(fig:NHDPlusHR-status)),
we used the NHD Best Resolution File for the state of AK [@usgeologicalsurvey].

```{r NHDPlusHR-status, echo=F, fig.cap="NHDPlusHR dataset availability, courtesy of the USGS."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/media/images/NHDPlusHRStatus_Web_20220707_0.png")
```

For every HUC4 included in the NHDPlusHR dataset and the state of Alaska NHD
Best Resolution dataset, all waterbodies are limited to those with
[FCodes](https://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/op/gis/data/NHD%20Complete%20FCode%20Attribute%20Value%20List.pdf)
belonging to the following groups: 390 (lake/pond), 436 (reservoir), and 361
(playa) and are at least 0.01 km^2^ (1 hectare) in area according to the area
value provided in the NHD file. This filtering resulted in
`r format(nrow(combined_poi_points), big.mark = ",")` waterbodies included in
our dataset, including `r format(nrow(AK_poi_points), big.mark = ",")` from
Alaska.

For each waterbody, the POI and distance-to-shore radius was calculated using
the `polylabelr::poi()` function. In order to accurately calculate
distance-to-shore, each waterbody was converted to the proper Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection calculated from the mean longitudinal value
of the polygon vertices prior to applying the `poi()` function. By using the
point-local UTM projection, we decrease distortion expected from any single CRS
used to represent all of the locations from which we have lakes. The latitude
and longitude values of the POI were transformed to decimal degrees in World
Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) (EPSG:4326) from UTM easting and northing
coordinates for use later in the workflow. It is
important to note that the `poi()` function does not perform particularly well
on larger polygons, however the points calculated should be an acceptable proxy
for pelagic lake conditions. [[Will add additional detail from analysis of
buffer sizes.]]

## Implementation

The code for gathering NHD waterbodies and calculating their respective POIs is
found in {targets} group *a_Calculate_Centers* which is located in the script
[a_Calculate_Centers.R](https://github.com/aquasat/lakeSR/blob/main/a_Calculate_Centers.R).
The network graph (Figure \@ref(fig:a-group-vis)) for this group depicts the
dependencies between each of the *targets* in this group.

```{r a-group-vis, fig.cap= "Network graph of the *targets* in the a_Calculate_Centers {targets} group."}

with_dir("..", {
  tar_visnetwork(targets_only = T, label = "branches",
             names = c(US_state_territories, 
                       HUC4_dataframe,
                       HUC4_list,
                       all_poi_points,
                       collated_poi_points,
                       NHDHR_poi_points,
                       NHDHR_poi_points_noAK,
                       make_AK_poi_points,
                       AK_poi_points,
                       combined_poi_file,
                       combined_poi_points))
  })
```

On a high level, the processing begins by acquiring the polygons of all US
states and territories using the {tigris} package [@walker2023]
(*US_state_territories*). These polygons are used to acquire a list HUC4s that
intersect with each municipal boundary using the `nhdplusTools::get_huc()`
function (*HUC4_dataframe*), which are then reduced to distinct HUC4's and
transformed into a vector of HUC4s (*HUC4_list*). As an error-handling measure,
*empty_hucs_file* is created (not pictured in Figure \@ref(fig:a-group-vis)) to
collect a list of HUC4s that do not have high resolution files available for
download (Figure \@ref(fig:NHDPlusHR-status)). The target *all_poi_points* is
created by calculating POIs for all waterbodies \> 1 hectare and having an FCode
of 390, 436, or 361 from each HUC4 in the *HUC4_list.* For this target, we use
the dynamic branching feature to iterate over each item in the *HUC4_list*. See
the script
[calculate_centers_HUC4.R](https://github.com/aquasat/lakeSR/blob/main/a_Calculate_Centers/src/calculate_centers_HUC4.R)
for details on the function applied in this target. The output of the
*all_poi_points* target include multiple *.csv* files - these files are collated
in the target *all_poi_points*, which outputs a *.feather* file (tracked as
*NHDHR_poi_points*) containing all the POIs resulting from the NHDPlusHR polygon
files.

The NHDPlusHR contains a small number of sub-HUC4 waterbodies (specifically a
few HUC8's and HUC10's) in the state of AK, but to make processing more
straightforward, POIs from polygons from the NHDPlusHR that were from these
files were removed (*NHD_poi_points_noAK*). The target *make_AK_poi_points*
downloads the NHD Best Resolution geopackage and calculates POIs for each
waterbody polygon of the same size and type as stated previously. (See the
script
[calculate_AK_poi.R](https://github.com/aquasat/lakeSR/blob/main/a_Calculate_Centers/src/calculate_AK_poi.R))
The resulting file (tracked as *AK_poi_points*), is combined with the
*NHD_poi_points_noAK* target to create a harmonized and collated file in the
target *combined_poi_file* (see
[collate_NHDHR_AK.R](https://github.com/aquasat/lakeSR/blob/main/a_Calculate_Centers/src/collate_NHDHR_AK.R),
the output file istracked as *combined_poi_points*).
