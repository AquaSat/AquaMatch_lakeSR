# Locations of Data Acquisition {#locs-data-acq}

As noted in the Introduction (Section \@ref(introduction)), for the purposes of
AquaSat v2, surface reflectance and surface temperature data are acquired at
specific, centrally-located points within waterbodies (typically in pelagic
locations of lakes, lakeSR) and at locations where there are *in situ* data
(siteSR). The data acquired at locations where there are *in situ* data are
meant to create location-specific algorithms using the AquaMatch database, which
can then be applied to the data collected over the centrally-located point
across all waterbodies in the lakeSR database. lakeSR does not acquire nor
summarize data over the entire waterbody's surface, as it is computationally
impractical for most large lakes, especially those that cross multiple satellite
path-rows or tiles. For the lakeSR product, we summarize the Landsat data within
a 120 meter radius of a defined location. For siteSR, we use a 200 meter buffer.

## Waterbodies Included in lakeSR {#waterbodies}

For lakeSR, we use the NHDPlusV2 dataset for lakes within the conterminous US
and US Territories using the {nhdplusTools} R package [@blodgett2023] and the
NHD Best Resolution [e.g. @usgs-nhd-ak] data through The National Map. All
waterbody polygons were downloaded and processed in `r params$locs_run_date` by
HUC4 using the most updated version available at the time of download.

```{r NHDPlusV2-HUC4, echo=F, fig.cap="NHD HUC4 map for the United States and Territories, courtesy of the USGS."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/WBD_SubRegions_24x18.png")
```

For every HUC4 in the United States and Territories (Figure
\@ref(fig:NHDPlusV2-HUC4)), all waterbodies are limited to those with [NHD
Waterbody
Subtypes](https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-classes)
belonging to the following groups: 390 (lake/pond) and 436 (reservoir) and are
at least 0.01 km^2^ (1 hectare) in area according to the area value provided in
the NHD file. If the [feature type
(FType)](https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-domains)
of the waterbody belonged to an intermittent category (39001, 39005, 39006,
43614) the threshold for inclusion was increased to 0.04 km^2^ (4 hectares) to
reduce processing time when extracting data from Google Earth Engine. This
filtering resulted in `r format(nrow(a_poi_with_flags), big.mark = ",")`
waterbodies included in our dataset, including
`r format(nrow(nonCONUS), big.mark = ",")` non-CONUS waterbodies. This is a
`r format(round((nrow(a_poi_with_flags)-56792)*100/56792, 0), big.mark = ",")`
percent increase over the 56,792 lakes included in the original AquaSat product.

For each waterbody, the Pole of Inaccessibility (see Section \@ref(poi)) and
distance-to-shore radius was calculated using the `polylabelr::poi()` function.
It is important to note that the `poi()` function can sometimes attribute a POI
to a location other than the point furthest away from a shoreline. This occurs
in polygons with a very large number of indices (due to sheer area or
geomorphological complexity); however the points calculated should be an
acceptable proxy for pelagic lake conditions.

### Updates in AquaSat v2

Some changes in lake polygon and center point have been made in modernizing and
scaling from LimnoSat-US. The lake center aspect called "deepest point" of
LimnoSat-US was built upon HydroLakes [@messager2016], a global database of
lakes greater than 10 hectares accounting for 1.4 million waterbodies and a
total surface area of 2.67 million km² worldwide. While this dataset of lakes
represents \~55% of the worldwide surface area of lakes greater than 1 hectare,
it is only a sliver of the estimated 27 million waterbodies in the world
[@verpoorter2014]. AquaSat v2 uses the [USGS's National Hydrography
products](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography) which map the surface
waters of the United States, and allows for reduction in minimum size of
waterbody and an increase in coverage of freshwater systems across the United
States and permanently inhabited territories.

### Pole of Inaccessibility {#poi}

The USGS National Hydrography products contain smaller and higher resolution
polygons than the HydroLakes shapes, which makes it computationally impossible
to use the Chebyshev Center ["deepest point", @yang2020] calculation used in
LimnoSat-US due to the number of vertices in each polygon. To replace this
important step in the update, we employ the concept of "pole of inaccessibility"
[POI, @stefansson1920].

The concept of POI is used to define the geographic center of a circle with the
largest circumference within any complex polygon. The foundational principle is
used widely to describe the arctic pole of inaccessiblity, that is the point in
the northern arctic circle that is the furthest from land, but has also been
used to describe the geographic center of landmasses [@garcia-castellanos2007].
For lakeSR, we use POI to determine the point in a waterbody that is furthest
from the shoreline using the `polylabelr::poi()` function [@larsson2020], which
calculates a point in space and the radius of the circle used to define the POI.

### Technical Implementation of lakeSR

The code for gathering NHD waterbodies and calculating their respective POIs is
found in {targets} group *a_Calculate_Centers* which is located in the script
[a_Calculate_Centers.R](https://github.com/aquasat/lakeSR/blob/main/a_Calculate_Centers.R)
at the root directory of the repository.

The processing begins by acquiring the polygons of all US states and territories
using the {tigris} package [@walker2023]. These polygons are used to acquire a
list HUC4s that intersect with each municipal boundary using the
`nhdplusTools::get_huc()` function, which are then reduced to distinct HUC4's
and transformed into a vector of HUC4s. HUC4s are then split into CONUS (HUC4 \<
1900) and non-CONUS (HUC4 ≥ 1900) groups. To efficiently calculate the POI
across hundreds of HUC4s, we use the dynamic branching feature to iterate over
each HUC4. For each HUC4, the NHDPlusV2 (CONUS) or NHD Best Resolution (non
CONUS) waterbodies are acquired and filtered for lake/ponds and reservoirs of at
least 1 hectare in area or 4 hectares for intermittent lake/ponds or reservoirs.

In order to accurately calculate distance-to-shore when using the
`polylabelr::poi()` function as described in Section \@ref(waterbodies), each
waterbody was converted to the proper Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
projection calculated from the mean longitudinal value of the polygon vertices
prior to applying the poi() function. By using the point-local UTM projection,
we decrease distortion expected from any single CRS used to represent all of the
locations from which we have lakes. The latitude and longitude values of the POI
were transformed to decimal degrees in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84,
EPSG:4326) from UTM easting and northing coordinates for use later in the
workflow.

To increase computational efficiency, we allow for multicore processing and the
use of `targets::crew_controller_local()` function within this workflow. This
reduces processing time substantially as processing thousands of polygons is
quite time consuming. If you are running this workflow on your own computer, the
length of time that it takes to calculate POIs will be dependent on the number
of cores you allow for processing (we used `r parallel::detectCores()-1` cores
during the development of this workflow and it takes on the order of tens of
minutes).

### Flagging shoreline proximity {#lakeSR-shoreline}

Within the context of lakeSR, we do not identify whether there are multiple
waterbodies/visible water sources within the site buffer used for lakeSR
extraction. We do offer two flags to help users assess possibilities of
shoreline contamination through a simple calculation. This calculation is based
on the distance to shore calculated in the POI step, which does not account for
differing shoreline locations due to water surface level change. A flagged pixel
for shoreline proximity also does not imply that the data are contaminated,
rather is intended as a diagnostic tool to identify sites that may be more
likely to have some sort of shoreline contamination.

To determine the possibility of shoreline contamination, we add the site buffer
used for GEE extraction (defined in the lakeSR GEE configuration file) to the
pixel size of the sensor used for reflectance detection (see Section
\@ref(sensor-resolution) for details). For optical bands (Red, Green, Blue, Nir,
Swir) we use the site buffer plus 30 meters. For thermal bands, we create 3 flag
columns for each sensor's (Landsat 4/5: TM, Landsat 7: ETM, Landsat 8/9: TIRS)
native thermal resolution (120, 60, 100 meters). These flags are binary:

> 0: unlikely shoreline contamination (distance to shore is greater than the sum
> of the site buffer and pixel size)
>
> 1: possible shoreline contamination (distance to shore is less than or equal
> to sum of the site buffer and pixel size)

### Case Study: Wisconsin Waterbodies

```{r}
# grab state of Wisconsin
WI <- states(progress_bar = FALSE) %>% filter(STUSPS == "WI") %>% st_transform("EPSG:4326")

# grab all the pois and create a sf out of them
poi_sf <- st_as_sf(a_poi_with_flags, 
                   coords = c("poi_Longitude", "poi_Latitude"), 
                   crs = "EPSG:4326")
# filter to WI
WI_poi <- poi_sf[WI, ]

# get the waterbodies from the NHD and filter like in workflow
WI_wbd <- get_waterbodies(AOI = WI) %>% 
  filter(areasqkm > 0.01, ftype %in% c("LakePond", "Reservoir"))
intermittent_small <- WI_wbd %>% 
  filter(areasqkm < 0.04, fcode %in% c(39001, 39005, 39006, 43614))

# join, and remove Great Lakes
WI_wbd_noGL <- WI_wbd[!WI_wbd$comid %in% intermittent_small$comid, ]
WI_wbd_noGL <- st_make_valid(WI_wbd_noGL) %>% 
  filter(areasqkm < 700)
# and make sure they have associated pois
WI_wbd_poi <- WI_wbd_noGL[WI_poi, ]

# load in Wisconsin lakes in hydrolakes
WI_HL <- read_sf("../bookdown/data/WI_hydrolakes.gpkg") %>% 
  filter(Lake_area < 700)
# and the DP form AquaSat1
HL_DP <- read_sf("../bookdown/data/HydroLakes_DP.shp") %>% 
  # only grab deepest point
  filter(type == "dp") 
# filter the dp for WI area
WI_HL_DP <- HL_DP[WI, ]

WI_for_viz <- state_boundaries_wgs84 %>% 
  filter(STATE_ABBR == "WI", TYPE == "Land")

```

The state of Wisconsin contains more than 15,000 freshwater lakes. LimnoSat-US
contained just `r format(nrow(WI_HL_DP), big.mark = ",")` waterbodies within
Wisconsin (Figure \@ref(fig:v1-WI-lakes)), whereas AquaSat v2 via the lakeSR
product includes `r format(nrow(WI_poi), big.mark = ",")` (Figure
\@ref(fig:v2-WI-lakes)) - accounting for a majority of the state's freshwater
water bodies.

## siteSR_WQP Acquisition Locations {#siteSR-locs}

The AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP workflow outputs site metadata for all sites that
are present after the harmonization procedure for each parameter. siteSR_WQP
collates these sites, then reduces that collation to only distinct sites. Across
chlorophyll-*a*, Secchi disc depth, and DOC, there are currently
`r format(nrow(p4_WQP_site_NHD_info), big.mark = ",")` distinct sites in the
United States and Territories for which we create stacks.

Every site in the WQP has a `MonitoringLocationTypeName` associated with it. For
the purposes of siteSR_WQP, we do not subset the sites by these types, but they
are helpful for understanding the type of data included in siteSR_WQP.

```{r siteSR-types, fig.cap="Water Quality Portal data location types present in siteSR_WQP. Unique WQP monitoring location count above bar, divided by `MonitoringLocationTypeName`."}
ggplot(p4_WQP_site_NHD_info, aes(x = MonitoringLocationTypeName)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, colour = "black", size = 3)
```

For siteSR, we will acquire Landsat stacks for all sites deemed "visible" by
remote sensing (see Section \@ref(rs-vis)). Note that this is different from
lakeSR, where we only acquire data for lakes, reservoirs, ponds, and streams
according to the NHD. This was a functional choice, as most canal sites will not
be RS-visible and estuary extents are limited in the NHD (and when present the
technique to determine the POI may not be appropriate).

### Assessing for RS visibility {#rs-vis}

We use the JRC Global Surface Water Mapping Layers v1.4 [@pekel2016] to
determine whether or not sites are visible by remote sensing and should
therefore be sent through the GEE data acquisition process detailed in Section
\@ref(LS-SRST-pull). This dataset is a compilation of 38 years of the Landsat
record and enumerates the proportion of time a single 30x30 meter pixel has the
presence of water. As long as a WQP monitoring location has at least one pixel
within a 200 meter radius that has had water at least 80% of the time during
that 38 year period, we include it in the list of sites we acquire Landsat
stacks for. After this assessment,
`r format(nrow(p5_visible_sites), big.mark = ",")` sites were deemed to be
visible by remote sensing.

```{r siteSR-filtered, fig.cap="Water Quality Portal data location types present in siteSR_WQP after filitering for those that are deemed visible by remote sensing. Count of sites provided above bar, divided by `MonitoringLocationTypeName`."}
p5_visible_sites %>% 
  rename(siteSR_id = id) %>% 
  left_join(., p4_WQP_site_NHD_info) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = MonitoringLocationTypeName)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, colour = "black", size = 3)
```

### Assignment of NHD flowline and waterbodies {#fl-wb-assignment}

For each WQP montioring location, we attempt to assign HUC8's wherever they are
missing from the `HUCEightDigitCode` column output from the WQP (n =
`r p4_WQP_site_NHD_info %>% filter(flag_HUC8 != 0) %>% nrow(.)`). To do this we
use the `get_huc()` function from {nhdplusTools} [@blodgett2023] package in R.
After HUC8 assignment is finished only
`r p4_WQP_site_NHD_info %>% filter(flag_HUC8 == 2) %>% nrow(.)` sites remained
without a HUC8 assignment. All of these sites were coastal sites outside of the
extent of NHD boundaries. In siteSR_WQP, the `flag_HUC8` column indicates whether
this HUC8 was assigned within the WQP (value of 0), assigned in this process
(value of 1), or was unable to be assigned (value of 2).

Using the HUC8 information to iterate, we then can use {nhdplusTools} to assign
waterbodies and flowlines to sites within the CONUS and data from The National
Map best resolution files [e.g. @usgs-nhd-ak] for sites outside of CONUS by
HUC4. For all sites with a `MonitoringLocationTypeName` that contains the words "lake" or
"reservoir", we assign NHD ids to each point for the waterbody it is contained
by or the waterbody it is closest to. NHD waterbody file has been filtered to
only contain Lake, Ponds, and Reservoirs (NHD feature types 390 and 436) when performing this task. We
flag (`flag_wb`) the results of this assignment as follows:

> 0: point inside NHD waterbody polygon
>
> 1: point within GEE buffer distance (default 200 m for siteSR) proximate to
> NHD waterbody
>
> 2: point between GEE buffer distance and 500m proximate to NHD waterbody
> polygon
>
> 3: point unable to be assigned to waterbody (it is \> 500m proximate to NHD
> waterbody polygon)
>
> 4: point does not have HUC8 assignment or MonitoringLocationTypeName does not
> contain "lake" or "reservoir". No waterbody is assigned.

For all points with a flag value of 0 or 1 we provide the NHD identifier for the
polygon the monitoring location is associated with (comid for NHDPlusV2 and
permanent identifier for NHD Best Resolution), for all points with a flag value
of 1 or 2, we provide the distance (in meters) to the nearest NHD waterbody of
feature type 390 or 436. For waterbodies with a flag of 0, we provide distance
to shore. We follow lakeSR's implementation of flags for shoreline proximity for
these sites as well, but with the siteSR default site buffer of 200 m instead of
lakeSR's buffer of 120 m.

Flowlines are assigned to sites with a MonitoringLocationTypeName that contains
"lake", "reservoir", "stream", or "river". NHD flowlines are filtered to contain
streams/rivers and artificial paths (that is flowlines in waterbodies) (NHD
feature types 460 and 558). We flag (`flag_fl`) the results of this assignment
as follows:

> 0: point \<= 100m proximate to flowline
>
> 1: point between 100m and GEE buffer distance (default 200 m for siteSR)
> proximate to flowline
>
> 2: point between GEE buffer distance and 500 m proximate to flowline
>
> 3: point unable to be assigned to flowline for a stream site because distance
> to nearest stream \> 500 m
>
> 4: point is a lake or reservoir site and is \> 500m proximate to flowline
>
> 5: point does not have HUC8 assignment or MonitoringLocationTypeName does not
> contain "stream", "river", "lake", or "reservoir". No flowline assigned.

For all points with a flag 0/1/2 we provide the NHD identifier for the flowline
the monitoring location is associated with (comid for NHDPlusV2 and permanent
identifier for NHD Best Resolution), for all points with a flag value of 1-3, we
provide the distance (in meters) to the nearest NHD flowline of feature type 460
or 558.

For all sites, we calculate how many waterbodies or flowlines are within the
buffer distance set in the siteSR GEE configuration file. Any site that has more
than one waterbody and/or flow line within the buffer distance may be including
reflectance data from another surface water source. Within the context of
siteSR, we do not investigate what, if any, impacts multiple waterbodies,
flowlines, or combinations thereof have on the validity of the reflectance data
or thermal data summary.

We provide these identifiers and additional metadata to help users make informed
decisions about data quality that may be inferred through the information
included in these columns relative to the remote sensing data obtained in
siteSR, they are present to assist in data interpretation.

### siteSR_WQP updates in AquaSat v2

In our updated workflow, we acquire and provide the historical Landsat stacks
for all sites collated from the harmonization pipeline, regardless of whether
they are associated with a specific *in situ* observation. In the previous
iteration, we only provided a matchup dataset for *in situ* data. Assigning
flowlines and waterbodies to all siteSR sites is also a feature introduced in
AquaSat v2.
