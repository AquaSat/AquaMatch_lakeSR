# Locations of Data Acquisition {#locs-data-acq}

As noted in the Introduction (Section \@ref(introduction)), for the purposes of
**AquaSat**, surface reflectance and surface temperature data are acquired at
specific, centrally-located points within waterbodies (typically in pelagic
locations of lakes, **lakeSR**) and at locations where there are *in situ* data
(**siteSR**). The data acquired at locations where there are *in situ* data are
meant to create location-specific algorithms using the **AquaMatch** database,
which can then be applied to the data collected over the centrally-located point
across all waterbodies in the **lakeSR** database. **lakeSR** does not acquire
nor summarize data over the entire waterbody's surface, as it is computationally
impractical for most large lakes, especially those that cross multiple satellite
path-rows or tiles. For both **lakeSR** and **siteSR**, we summarize the Landsat
data within a 120m radius of a defined location.

## Changes from AquaSat v1

Some changes in lake polygon and center point have been made in modernizing and
scaling from the original AquaSat. The lake center aspect called "deepest point"
of AquaSat v1 was built upon HydroLakes [@messager2016], a global database of
lakes greater than 10 hectares accounting for 1.4 million waterbodies and a a
total surface area of 2.67 million km² worldwide. While this dataset of lakes
represents \~55% of the worldwide surface area of lakes greater than 1 hectare,
it is only a sliver of the estimated 27 million waterbodies in the world
[@verpoorter2014]. AquaSat v2 uses the [USGS's National Hydrography
products](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography) which map the surface
waters of the United States, and allows for reduction in minimum size of
waterbody and an increase in coverage of freshwater systems across the United
States and permanently inhabited territories.

## Pole of Inaccessibility

The USGS National Hydrography products contain smaller waterbodies and higher
resolution polygons than the HydroLakes shapes, which makes it computationally
impossible to use the Chebyshev Center ("deepest point", @yang2020) calculation
used in AquaSat v1 due to the number of vertices in each polygon. To replace
this important step in the update, we employ the concept of "pole of
inaccessibility" (POI) [@stefansson1920], which can handle complex polygons in
the R environment with minimal computational investment.

The concept of POI is used to define the geographic center of a circle with the
largest circumference within any complex polygon. The foundational principle is
used widely to describe the arctic pole of inaccessiblity, that is the point in
the northern arctic circle that is the furthest from land, but has also been
used to describe the geographic center of landmasses [@garcia-castellanos2007].
For **lakeSR**, we use POI to determine the point in a waterbody that is
furthest from the shoreline using the `polylabelr::poi()` function
[@larsson2020], which calculates a point in space and the radius of the circle
used to define the POI.

## Waterbodies in AquaMatch-lakeSR {#waterbodies}

For **lakeSR**, we use the NHDPlusV2 dataset for lakes within the conterminous
US and US Territories using the {nhdplusTools} R package [@blodgett2023] and the
NHD Best Resolution [@usgeologicalsurvey] data through The National Map. All
HUC4s were downloaded and processed in `r params$locs_run_date` using the most
updated version available at the time of download.

```{r NHDPlusV2-HUC4, echo=F, fig.cap="NHD HUC4 map for the United States and Territories, courtesy of the USGS."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/WBD_SubRegions_24x18.png")
```

For every HUC4 in the United States and Territories (Figure
\@ref(fig:NHDPlusV2-HUC4)), all waterbodies are limited to those with [NHD
Waterbody
Subtypes](https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-classes)
belonging to the following groups: 390 (lake/pond) and 436 (reservoir) and are
at least 0.01 km^2^ (1 hectare) in area according to the area value provided in
the NHD file. If the [feature type
(FType)](https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-domains)
of the waterbody belonged to an intermittent category (39001, 39005, 39006,
43614) the threshold for inclusion was increased to 0.04 km^2^ (4 hectares) to
reduce processing time when extracting data from Google Earth Engine. This
filtering resulted in `r format(nrow(params$poi), big.mark = ",")` waterbodies
included in our dataset, including `r format(nrow(nonCONUS), big.mark = ",")`
non-CONUS waterbodies. This is a
`r format(round((nrow(params$poi)-56792)*100/56792, 0), big.mark = ",")` percent
increase over the 56,792 lakes included in the original AquaSat product.

For each waterbody, the POI and distance-to-shore radius was calculated using
the `polylabelr::poi()` function. It is important to note that the `poi()`
function can sometimes attribute a POI to a location other than the point
furthest away from a shoreline. This occurs in polygons with a very large number
of indices (due to sheer area or geomorphological complexity); however the
points calculated should be an acceptable proxy for pelagic lake conditions.

## Technical Implementation

The code for gathering NHD waterbodies and calculating their respective POIs is
found in {targets} group *a_Calculate_Centers* which is located in the script
[a_Calculate_Centers.R](https://github.com/aquasat/lakeSR/blob/main/a_Calculate_Centers.R)
at the root directory of the repository.

The processing begins by acquiring the polygons of all US states and territories
using the {tigris} package [@walker2023]. These polygons are used to acquire a
list HUC4s that intersect with each municipal boundary using the
`nhdplusTools::get_huc()` function, which are then reduced to distinct HUC4's
and transformed into a vector of HUC4s. HUC4s are then split into CONUS (HUC4 \<
1900) and non-CONUS (HUC4 ≥ 1900) groups. To efficiently calculate the POI
across hundreds of HUC4s, we use the dynamic branching feature to iterate over
each HUC4. For each HUC4, the NHDPlusV2 (CONUS) or NHD Best Resolution (non
CONUS) waterbodies are acquired and filtered for lake/ponds and reservoirs of at
least 1 hectare in area or 4 hectares for intermittent lake/ponds or reservoirs.

In order to accurately calculate distance-to-shore when using the
`polylabelr::poi()` function as described in Section \@ref(waterbodies), each
waterbody was converted to the proper Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
projection calculated from the mean longitudinal value of the polygon vertices
prior to applying the poi() function. By using the point-local UTM projection,
we decrease distortion expected from any single CRS used to represent all of the
locations from which we have lakes. The latitude and longitude values of the POI
were transformed to decimal degrees in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84,
EPSG:4326) from UTM easting and northing coordinates for use later in the
workflow.

To increase computational efficiency, we allow for multicore processing and the
use of `targets::crew_controller_local()` function within this workflow. This
reduces processing time substantially as processing thousands of polygons is
quite time consuming. If you are running this workflow on your own computer, the
length of time that it takes to calculate POIs will be dependent on the number
of cores you allow for processing (we used `r parallel::detectCores()-1` cores
during the development of this workflow and it takes on the order of tens of
minutes).

## Case Study: Wisconsin Waterbodies

```{r}
# grab state of Wisconsin
WI <- states(progress_bar = FALSE) %>% filter(STUSPS == "WI") %>% st_transform("EPSG:4326")

# grab all the pois and create a sf out of them
poi_sf <- st_as_sf(params$poi, 
                   coords = c("poi_Longitude", "poi_Latitude"), 
                   crs = "EPSG:4326")
# filter to WI
WI_poi <- poi_sf[WI, ]

# get the waterbodies from the NHD and filter like in workflow
WI_wbd <- get_waterbodies(AOI = WI) %>% 
  filter(areasqkm > 0.01, ftype %in% c("LakePond", "Reservoir"))
intermittent_small <- WI_wbd %>% 
  filter(areasqkm < 0.04, fcode %in% c(39001, 39005, 39006, 43614))

# join, and remove Great Lakes
WI_wbd_noGL <- WI_wbd[!WI_wbd$comid %in% intermittent_small$comid, ]
WI_wbd_noGL <- st_make_valid(WI_wbd_noGL) %>% 
  filter(areasqkm < 700)
# and make sure they have associated pois
WI_wbd_poi <- WI_wbd_noGL[WI_poi, ]

# load in Wisconsin lakes in hydrolakes
WI_HL <- read_sf("../bookdown/data/WI_hydrolakes.gpkg") %>% 
  filter(Lake_area < 700)
# and the DP form AquaSat1
HL_DP <- read_sf("../bookdown/data/HydroLakes_DP.shp") %>% 
  # only grab deepest point
  filter(type == "dp") 
# filter the dp for WI area
WI_HL_DP <- HL_DP[WI, ]

WI_for_viz <- state_boundaries_wgs84 %>% 
  filter(STATE_ABBR == "WI", TYPE == "Land")

```

The state of Wisconsin contains more than 15,000 freshwater lakes. AquaSat v1
contained just `r format(nrow(WI_HL_DP), big.mark = ",")` waterbodies within
Wisconsin (Figure \@ref(fig:v1-WI-lakes)), whereas the our update includes
`r format(nrow(WI_poi), big.mark = ",")` (Figure \@ref(fig:v2-WI-lakes)) -
accounting for a majority of the state's freshwater water bodies.
