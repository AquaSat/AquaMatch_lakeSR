# Locations of Data Acquisition {#locs-data-acq}

As noted in the Introduction (Section \@ref(introduction)), for the purposes of
**AquaSat**, surface reflectance and surface temperature data are acquired at
specific, centrally-located points within waterbodies (typically in pelagic
locations of lakes, **lakeSR**) and at locations where there are *in situ* data
(**siteSR**). The data acquired at locations where there are *in situ* data are
acquired to create location-specific algorithms using the **AquaMatch**
database, which can then be applied to the data collected over the
centrally-located point across all waterbodies in the **lakeSR** database.
**lakeSR** does not acquire nor summarize data over the entire waterbody's
surface, as it is computationally impractical for most large lakes that cross
multiple satellite path-rows or tiles. For both **lakeSR** and **siteSR**, we
summarize the Landsat data within a 120m radius of any given location.

## Changes from AquaSat v1

Some changes in lake polygon and center point have been made in modernizing and
scaling from the original AquaSat. The lake center aspect called "deepest point"
of AquaSat v1 was built upon HydroLakes [@messager2016], a global database of
lakes greater than 10 hectares accounting for 1.4 million waterbodies and a a
total surface area of 2.67 million kmÂ² worldwide. While this dataset of lakes
represents \~55% of the worldwide surface area of lakes greater than 1 hectare,
it is only a sliver of the estimated 27 million waterbodies in the world
[@verpoorter2014]. AquaSat v2 uses the [USGS's National Hydrography
products](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography) which map the surface
waters of the United States, and allows for reduction in minimum size of
waterbody and an increase in coverage of freshwater systems across the United
States and territories.

## Pole of Inaccessibility

The USGS National Hydrography products contain smaller waterbodies and higher
resolution polygons than the HydroLakes shapes, which makes it computationally
impossible to use the Chebyshev Center ("deepest point", @yang2020) calculation
used in AquaSat v1 due to the number of vertices in each polygon. To replace
this important step in this update, we employ the concept of "pole of
inaccessibility" (POI) [@stefansson1920], which handles complex polygons in the
R environment with minimal computational investment.

The concept of POI is used to define the geographic center of a circle with the
largest circumference within any complex polygon. The foundational principle is
used widely to describe the arctic pole of inaccessiblity, that is the point in
the northern arctic circle that is the furthest from land, but has also been
used to describe the geographic center of landmasses [@garcia-castellanos2007].
For **lakeSR**, we use POI to determine the point in a lake that is furthest
from the shoreline using the `polylabelr::poi()` function [@larsson2020], which
calculates a point in space and the radius of the circle used to define the POI.

## Waterbodies in AquaMatch-lakeSR {#waterbodies}

For **lakeSR**, we use the NHDPlusV2 dataset for lakes within the conterminous
US and US Territories using the {nhdplusTools} R package [@blodgett2023]. All
HUC4s were downloaded and processed on `r date(ymd_hms(ts))` using the most
updated version available at the time of download. Because the NHDPlusV2 dataset
is incomplete for Alaska (Figure \@ref(fig:NHDPlusV2-status)), we used the NHD
Best Resolution File [@usgeologicalsurvey] for the state of AK and territories.

```{r NHDPlusV2-status, echo=F, fig.cap="NHD HUC4 map for the United States and Territories, courtesy of the USGS."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/WBD_SubRegions_24x18.png")
```

For every HUC4 in the United States and Territories, all waterbodies are limited
to those with
[FCodes](https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-domains)
belonging to the following groups: 390 (lake/pond) and 436 (reservoir) and are
at least 0.01 km^2^ (1 hectare) in area according to the area value provided in
the NHD file. If the FType of the waterbody belonged to an intermittent category
(39001, 39005, 39006, 43614) the threshold for inclusion was reduced to 0.04
km^2^ (4 hectares) to reduce processing time when extracting data from Google
Earth Engine. This filtering resulted in
`r format(nrow(params$poi), big.mark = ",")` waterbodies included in our
dataset, including `r format(nrow(nonCONUS), big.mark = ",")` non-CONUS
waterbodies. This is a
`r format(round((nrow(params$poi)-56792)*100/56792, 0), big.mark = ",")` percent
increase over the 56,792 lakes included in the original AquaSat product.

For each waterbody, the POI and distance-to-shore radius was calculated using
the `polylabelr::poi()` function. It is important to note that the `poi()`
function can sometimes attribute a POI to a location other than the point
furthest away from a shoreline. This occurs with polygons with a very large
number of indices (due to sheer area or geomorphological complexity); however
the points calculated should be an acceptable proxy for pelagic lake conditions.

## Technical Implementation

The code for gathering NHD waterbodies and calculating their respective POIs is
found in {targets} group *a_Calculate_Centers* which is located in the script
[a_Calculate_Centers.R](https://github.com/aquasat/lakeSR/blob/main/a_Calculate_Centers.R)
at the root directory of the repository.

The processing begins by acquiring the polygons of all US states and territories
using the {tigris} package [@walker2023]. These polygons are used to acquire a
list HUC4s that intersect with each municipal boundary using the
`nhdplusTools::get_huc()` function, which are then reduced to distinct HUC4's
and transformed into a vector of HUC4s. HUC4s are then split into CONUS (HUC4 \<
1900) and non-CONUS (HUC4 \>= 1900) groups. To efficiently calculate the POI
across hundreds of HUC4s, we use the dynamic branching feature to iterate over
each HUC4. For each HUC4, the NHDPlusV2 (CONUS) or NHD Best Resolution (non
CONUS) waterbodies are acquired and filtered for lake/ponds and reservoirs of at
least 1 hectare in area or 4 hectares for intermittent lake/ponds or reservoirs.

In order to accurately calculate distance-to-shore when using the
`polylabelr::poi()` function as described in \@ref(waterbodies), each waterbody
was converted to the proper Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection
calculated from the mean longitudinal value of the polygon vertices prior to
applying the poi() function. By using the point-local UTM projection, we
decrease distortion expected from any single CRS used to represent all of the
locations from which we have lakes. The latitude and longitude values of the POI
were transformed to decimal degrees in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84,
EPSG:4326) from UTM easting and northing coordinates for use later in the
workflow.

To increase computational efficiency, we allow for multicore processing and the
use of `targets::crew_controller_local()` function within this workflow. This
reduces processing time substantially. If you are running this workflow on your
own computer, the length of time that it takes to calculate POIs will be
dependent on the number of cores you allow for processing (we used
`r parallel::detectCores()-1` cores during the development of this workflow).

## Case Study: Wisconsin Waterbodies

```{r}
# grab state of Wisconsin
WI <- states(progress_bar = FALSE) %>% filter(STUSPS == "WI") %>% st_transform("EPSG:4326")

# grab all the pois and create a sf out of them
poi_sf <- st_as_sf(params$poi, 
                   coords = c("poi_Longitude", "poi_Latitude"), 
                   crs = "EPSG:4326")
# filter to WI
WI_poi <- poi_sf[WI, ]

#grab the lakes from NHD
HUC4s <- WI_poi %>% 
  mutate(HUC4 = str_sub(r_id, 1, 4)) %>% 
  pull(HUC4) %>% 
  unique(.)
# get the waterbodies from the NHD and filter like in workflow
WI_wbd <- get_waterbodies(AOI = WI) %>% 
  filter(areasqkm > 0.01, ftype %in% c("LakePond", "Reservoir"))
intermittent_small <- WI_wbd %>% 
  filter(areasqkm < 0.04, fcode %in% c(39001, 39005))
# join, and remove Great Lakes
WI_wbd <- WI_wbd[!WI_wbd$comid %in% intermittent_small$comid, ]
WI_wbd <- st_make_valid(WI_wbd) %>% 
  filter(areasqkm < 700)

# load in Wisconsin lakes in hydrolakes
WI_HL <- read_sf("../bookdown/data/WI_hydrolakes.gpkg") %>% 
  filter(Lake_area < 700)
# and the DP form AquaSat1
HL_DP <- read_sf("../bookdown/data/HydroLakes_DP.shp") %>% 
  # only grab deepest point
  filter(type == "dp") 
WI_HL_DP <- HL_DP[WI, ]

```

The state of Wisconsin contains more than 15,000 freshwater lakes. AquaSat v1
contained just `r format(nrow(WI_HL_DP), big.mark = ",")` waterbodies within
Wisconsin (\@ref(fig:v1-WI-lakes)), whereas the our update includes
`r format(nrow(WI_poi), big.mark = ",")` (\@ref(fig:v2-WI-lakes)) - accounting
for a majority of the state's freshwater water bodies.
