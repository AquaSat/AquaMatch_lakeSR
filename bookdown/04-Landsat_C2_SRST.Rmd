# Landsat Collection 2 SRST {#LS-C2-SRST}

## Initialisms and Landsat Jargon

*SR*: surface reflectance product

*ST*: surface temperature product

*Collection 2 (C2)*: The second version of the Landsat record - the transition
to C2 began in 2020. There were extensive changes to the data storage and
metadata when moving from Collection 1 to C2. An overview of the differences is
available as a PDF download
[here](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-collection-1-vs-collection-2-summary)
from the USGS. AquaSat v1 and LimnoSat-US were based on Collection 1 data, which
are no longer available from the USGS and have been superseded by Collection 2
data.

*Data Tier*: a data tier for Landsat refers to data quality and processing.
lakeSR uses Tier 1 data exclusively which conform to the highest level of data
quality. To learn more about Landsat tiers, see [this video from the
USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/media/videos/landsat-collections-what-are-tiers).

*Data Processing Level (Level)*: a data processing level for Landsat refers to
how much the data have been processed. Level 1 (top of atmosphere) is less
processed than Level 2 (surface reflectance). lakeSR uses Level 2 data
exclusively, as it has gone through a standard atmospheric correction process
that attempts to standardize data handling through out the Landsat record - it
is *derived* from Level 1 data. NASA has compiled [a list of general data
processing levels and descriptions
here](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/earth-observation-data-basics/data-processing-levels).

*Landsat stack*: this is the collated Landsat historical dataset at a specific
location.

*Matchup*: a pair of observations, one from an *in situ* source, one from a
remote sensing source. Matchups are often defined by a time window relative to
the time of the *in situ* measurement, both before and after.

## Background Information {#valid-dates}

*The information presented in this section originates from the [NASA Landsat
Science website](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and has been summarized here
for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive
relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR.*

The Landsat archive of multispectral and thermal data in lakeSR is composed of
Landsat missions 4 through 9 and spans more than 40 years.

The image record for Landsat 4 is not consistent nor robust due to a data
transmitter failure early in service, however our pipeline acquires data as
available. Landsat 6 did not achieve orbit.

For the purposes of AquaSat v2, we truncate the data record for Landsat 4 and 5
at the end of the Science Mission of the satellite. No corrections were made for
the Landsat 7 scanline error that began on May 31, 2003, data were collected as
available despite the scanline error since the data are still of acceptable
quality [per the USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-landsat-7-etm-slc-data).
Additionally, Landsat 7 began to experience orbital drift beginning in 2017,
resulting in top-of-atmosphere (and therefore also surface reflectance) values
that had growing uncertainties over time as the drift increased [@qiu2021]. Qui
[-@qiu2021] suggests that data are not robust enough for trend analysis after
the start of the growing season in 2020, but because their analysis was of NDVI,
we conservatively truncate the data at the end of 2019.

### Spectral Response

While the nominal bands for each of the missions within the archive are
relatively consistent (with the addition of an Aerosol band beginning Landsat
8), the precise spectral response for each nominal band shifted beginning with
Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The image below visualizes the spectral response throughout
the Landsat archive.

### Sensor Resolution {#sensor-resolution}

The spatial resolution of the Level 1 data that the SR and ST products are
derived from has not changed for optical bands over time (Aerosol, RGB, NIR,
SWIR) but has varied over the historic record for thermal data:

+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Sensors        | Optical Bands  | Thermal Bands  |
+:==============:+:==============:+:==============:+
| TM             | 30             | 120            |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| ETM+           | 30             | 60             |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| OLI/TIRS       | 30             | 100            |
|                |                |                |
| OLI-2/TIRS-2   |                |                |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+

All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have
been resampled to 30m.

Alongside the pixel resolution of the sensors is the radiometric resolution at
which the data are stored. TM and ETM+ data are stored as 8-bit data products,
OLI data are quantitized to 12 bits and Landsat 9 to 14 bits. This equates to
256 shades per band for Landsat 4-7, 4,096 shades for Landsat 8 and 16,384
shades for Landsat 9, where higher numbers allow for greater precision of
measurement in a given band. All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and
Surface Temperature data have been rescaled to 16 bits.

## Surface Reflectance Product

*The information presented in this section originates from the [USGS Landsat
Collection 2 Surface
Reflectance](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-surface-reflectance)
product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing
background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and
use of lakeSR and siteSR products.*

The Landsat C2 SR product is a Level 2 data product that has been
atmospherically corrected from the Level 1 Top of Atmosphere product using a
myriad of inputs to create a reasonably consistent data product across space and
time. The USGS EROS describes the SR product as follows:

> *Surface reflectance improves comparison between multiple images over the same
> region by accounting for atmospheric effects such as aerosol scattering and
> thin clouds, which can help in the detection and characterization of Earth
> surface change. Surface reflectance is generated from Level-1 inputs that meet
> the \<76 degrees Solar Zenith Angle constraint and include the required
> auxiliary data inputs to generate a scientifically viable product.*

### SR Atmospheric Processing

The SR product for Landsat 4-7 is calculated using the Land Ecosystem
Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) [@schmidt2013] and Landsat 8 and
9 SR data are calculated using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC)
algorithm [@vermote2018]. The two algorithms are functionally different, but the
outcome is the same: a consistently-processed surface reflectance product that
is available worldwide. See the table under section heading ['Differences in
Surface Reflectance Processing Algorithms' on the USGS Landsat C2
website](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-surface-reflectance)
for details.

## Surface Temperature {#st-product}

*The information presented in this section originates from the [USGS Landsat
Collection 2 Surface
Temperature](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-surface-temperature)
product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing
background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and
use of lakeSR and siteSR products.*

The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature (ST) product is calculated using a
single-channel algorithm [@cook2014a; @cook2014b] to convert the thermal band
data to temperature estimates in degrees Kelvin. While these data are considered
interoperable over space and time with few differences in the ST algorithm
product within Collection 2, there do appear to be slight differences in the ST
product between sensors. Like with the surface reflectance product, we calculate
between-mission handoffs for the TM/ETM/TIRS products in Section
\@ref(define-handoff).

It is important to note that the thermal band resolution is coarser than the
optical bands in all Landsat missions (see Section \@ref(sensor-resolution)). At
this time we do not account for mixed thermal pixel boundaries due to the
difference in pixel resolution between optical and thermal sensors in lakeSR or
siteSR outside of the flags described in Section \@ref(lakeSR-shoreline) and
Section \@ref(fl-wb-assignment). Additional data handling may be necessary to
use these data as precise estimates of water surface temperature given these
constraints.

We do provide surface temperature summary statistics in the siteSR product as
well, and users should approach the data with caution when a WQP monitoring site
is near to a shoreline. While we do not have explicit guidance for the use of
the surface temperature estimates for siteSR, we do provide some characteristics
of sites and their relationships to NHD flowlines and waterbodies (see Section
\@ref(fl-wb-assignment) additional descriptors). Users could use a combination
of `MonitoringLocationTypeName`, the flags assigned from our NHD assignment
process, and the distance columns from that process to assess whether or not the
temperature data is appropriate for a given site. Additional assessments may be
necessary to assess whether it is appropriate to use the temperature data for
discrete analysis of temperature trends/patterns. King, et al. (-@king) have
noted that handoff coefficients should be used for the surface temperature
product as well, see Section \@ref(define-handoff) for details.
