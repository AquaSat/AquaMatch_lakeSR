# Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature

## Background Information

*The information presented in this section originates from the [NASA Landsat
Science website](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and has been summarized here
for the purpose of providing background information about the Landsat archive
relevant to the creation and use of lakeSR.*

The Landsat archive of multispectral and thermal data in lakeSR is composed of
Landsat missions 4 through 9 and spans more than 40 years.

The image record for Landsat 4 is not consistent nor robust due to a data
transmitter failure early in service, however our pipeline acquires data as
available. Landsat 6 did not achieve orbit.

For the purposes of lakeSR, we truncate the data record for Landsat 4 and 5 at
the end of the Science Mission of the satellite. Landsat 7 began to experience
orbital drift beginning in 2017, resulting in top-of-atmosphere (and therefore
also surface reflectance data) that had growing uncertainties over time as the
drift increased [@qiu2021]. Qui [-@qiu2021] suggests that data are not robust
enough for trend analysis after the start of the growing season in 2020, but
because their analysis was of NDVI, we conservatively truncated the data at the
end of 2019.

### Spectral Response

While the nominal bands for each of the missions within the archive is
relatively consistent (with the addition of an Aerosol band beginning Landsat
8), the precise spectral response for each nominal band shifted beginning with
Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS:

### Sensor Resolution

The spatial resolution of the Level 1 data has not changed for optical bands
(Aerosol, RGB, NIR, SWIR) but has varied over the history for thermal data:

+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| Sensors             | Optical Bands       | Thermal Bands       |
+=====================+=====================+=====================+
| TM                  | 30                  | 120                 |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| ETM+                | 30                  | 60                  |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| OLI/TIRS            | 30                  | 100                 |
|                     |                     |                     |
| OLI-2/TIRS-2        |                     |                     |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+

All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature data have
been resampled to 30m in the USGS SRST product.

Alongside the pixel resolution of the sensors is the radiometric resolution at
which the data are stored. TM and ETM+ data are stored as 8-bit data products,
OLI data are quantitized to 12 bits and Landsat 9 to 14 bits. This equates to
256 shades per band for Landsat 4-7, 4,096 shades for Landsat 8 and 16,384
shades for Landsat 9, where higher numbers allow for greater precision of
measurement in a given band. All Collection 2 Level 2 Surface Reflectance and
Surface Temperature data have been rescaled to 16 bits.

## Surface Reflectance Product

*The information presented in this section originates from the [USGS Landsat
Collection 2 Surface
Reflectance](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-surface-reflectance)
product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing
background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and
use of lakeSR.*

The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance (SR) product is a Level 2 data
product that has been atmospherically corrected from the Level 1 Top of
Atmosphere product using a myriad of inputs to create a reasonably consistent
data product across space and time. The USGS EROS describes the SR product as
follows:

> *Surface reflectance improves comparison between multiple images over the same
> region by accounting for atmospheric effects such as aerosol scattering and
> thin clouds, which can help in the detection and characterization of Earth
> surface change. Surface reflectance is generated from Level-1 inputs that meet
> the \<76 degrees Solar Zenith Angle constraint and include the required
> auxiliary data inputs to generate a scientifically viable product.*

### SR Atmospheric Processing

The SR product for Landsat 4-7 is calculated using the Land Ecosystem
Distrubance Adaptive Procesing System (LEDAPS) [@schmidt2013] and Landsat 8 and
9 SR data are calculated using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC)
algorithm [@vermote2018]. The two algorithms are functionally different, but the
outcome is the same: a consistently-processed surface reflectance product that
is available worldwide. See the table under section heading ['Differences in
Surface Reflectance Processing Algorithms' on the USGS Landsat C2
website](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-surface-reflectance)
for details.

## Surface Temperature

*The information presented in this section originates from the [USGS Landsat
Collection 2 Surface
Temperature](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-surface-temperature)
product page and has been summarized here for the purpose of providing
background information about the Landsat archive relevant to the creation and
use of lakeSR.*

The Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature (ST) product is calculated using a
single-channel algorithm [@cook2014a; @cook2014b] to convert the thermal band
data to temperature estimates in degrees Kelvin. These data are considered
interoperable over space and time with few differences in the ST algorithm
product within Collection 2, with the acknowledgement of the previously-
documented spectral and radiometric resolution differences.
