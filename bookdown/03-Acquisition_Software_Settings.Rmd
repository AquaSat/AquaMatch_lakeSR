# Satellite Data Acquisition Software and Settings {#software-settings}

Currently, all satellite data in **AquaSat** are obtained using the Python API
for Google Earth Engine (GEE) [@gorelick2017]. While the orchestration of data
acquisition is performed by {targets}, a workflow management program for R, all
code directly related to GEE data acquisition is written in Python.

## {reticulate} Conda Environment

RStudio [@positteam2023] is an IDE that, alongside the {reticulate} package
[@ushey2023], facilitates integration of R and Python code within the same
environment. In **lakeSR**, we use [a singular R
script](https://github.com/AquaSat/lakeSR/blob/main/python/pySetup.R) to set up
a {reticulate} Conda environment that is invoked at the beginning of a {targets}
run (lines 8-12 of the
[\_targets.R](https://github.com/AquaSat/lakeSR/blob/main/_targets.R) file) to
be sure that our Python code runs consistently.

## Google Earth Engine Setup

### Create a GEE account

Creation of a GEE is easy and free. Click 'Get Started' at the far right side of
the [earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com) webpage to create
an account:

### gcloud CLI

This workflow requires the installation and initiation of [gcloud
CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud), a command-line tool set for accessing
Google Cloud Resources. All settings for **lakeSR** are default `gcloud`
configurations using a singular GEE project.

### GEE Authentication

Once `gcloud` is installed and initialized and the Conda environment is set up,
you can authenticate your GEE instance. For this workflow, this is completed in
the terminal and manually authenticating within the browser. See the
`run_targets.Rmd` file for directions to complete this task.

### GEE project setting

**lakeSR** is run in a specific GEE project associated with our authenticated
account. If you wish to re-run this code as written, you will not have proper
access because the code refers to our specific GEE project (each of the yaml
files in the `config_files` folder point to this within the `ee_proj` setting.
You will need to update this with your desired GEE project. If you are new to
GEE, go to [code.earthengine.google.com](https://code.earthengine.google.com)
and enter the project name listed in the top right hand corner of your screen:

Alternatively, you can create an GEE project for this task in the dropdown menu
accessed by clicking on the icon to the right of the highlighted box in the
figure above.
