# Post-Hoc Quality Assurance {#handoff}

Up until this point in the workflow, no data filtering has occurred other than
the masking procedures that eliminate obviously contaminated pixel-level data
due to sensor malfunction, clouds, haze, and glint as described in Section
\@ref(masking-functions). We also implement further QA filters for the remote
sensing stacks to assure high-quality data. These post-hoc filters are described
in \@ref(post-hoc-filters).

## Raw lakeSR stack collation {#raw-lakesr}

The data exported from the GEE tasks described in Section \@ref(LS-SRST-pull)
were collated into large compressed .feather files per DSWE type (DSWE1 and
DSWE1a), per Landsat mission, and per path prefix. The path prefix subset is
designed to reduce data corruption due to file size in the upload/download
process to Google Drive, where the collated files are stored for posterity and
to add functionality to this workflow. The Google Drive ids can be found at the
folder path `c_collate_Landsat_data/out/` and can be accessed without special

DSWE1a), per Landsat mission, and per path prefix. The path prefix subset is
designed to reduce data corruption due to file size in the upload/download
process to Google Drive, where the collated files are stored for posterity and
to add functionality to this workflow. The Google Drive ids can be found at the
folder path `c_collate_Landsat_data/out/` and can be accessed without special
permissions by downstream users. Many of these files are quite large (on the
order of many GBs) and are very difficult to handle outside of a programming or
database environment. We provide these files for advanced users who wish to make
changes to the QAQC or intermission handoff procedures. At the time of running
the pipeline, we assigned a max vector size ('R_MAX_VSIZE') of 40 GB using the
.Renviron document in this repository and it was run on a machine with 64 GB of
memory. If your system has less than 40 GB of memory, this portion of the
workflow may not successfully run.

## Post-hoc filters {#post-hoc-filters}

We acknowledge that even with the best masking procedures, our workflow may
still result in erroneous or misleading SR values. To address this we implement
post-hoc filters that are applied to the stack to reduce uncertainty in the
remote sensing data as much as possible.

-   total count of pixels (`pCount_dswe1` or `pCount_dswe1a`) contributing to
    summary values must be ≥ 8. This is a slight change from AquaSat v1 which
    required 10 pixels. Due to the more rigorous masking procedures (thant ASv1)
    we believe allows for a slightly more conservative QA filter via the
    reduction of required pixels for inclusion in the lakeSR dataset.

-   if the median temperature is below freezing (`med_SurfaceTemp` \< 273.15 °
    K), the row is dropped. This is our best attempt at removing data during any
    freezing period and also is an attempt at detecting clouds which can impact
    the thermal estimates. In particular, cirrus clouds can go unnoticed in
    cloud detection algorithms used that inform our masking procedures.

-   if the median temperature is greater than or euqal to 40°C (313.15 °K) the
    row is dropped. This maximum was defined based on the maximum value included
    @willard2021 composed of *in situ* measurementes and remote sensing
    estimates.

-   either NIR surface reflectance or SWIR1 and SWIR2 surface reflectance must
    be \< 0.1, this is to remove any extracted samples where sun glint has
    likely affected the data that was not masked in the RGB bands. In aquatic
    environments, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 surface reflectance values should be
    very low and these bands can be used for detecting sun glint affected areas
    [e.g. @mondejar2019, @vanhellemont2019]. Since NIR bands can be elevated in
    high-sediment waters [e.g., @doxaran2002] and SWIR can be elevated in high
    chlorophyll environments [e.g, @hu2009], and we did not wish to bias our
    dataset and remove data of this nature, we embraced this conditional
    approach.

While there are numerous other diagnostic tests we could apply to filter the RS
data, these are the QA filters that we deem to be the most foundational and
unifying for reliable RS data across the US and Territories. Figures
\@ref(fig:lake-ls4-dswe1-drop) through \@ref(fig:site-ls9-dswe1-drop) show how
many rows of data were dropped through this QA process. For the purposes of this
documentation, we show summaries for DSWE1 data only, but running the pipeline
locally results in summaries for both DSWE1 and DSWE1a data.
