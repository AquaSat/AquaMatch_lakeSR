# Background

Currently, lakeSR is comprised of the historical Landsat Collection 2 record
from 1984 until late 2024, comprised of data from the following missions:

-   Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM)
-   Landsat 5 TM
-   Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)
-   Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS)
-   Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS

There will be additional satellite data incorporated into the lakeSR data
product in the future.

lakeSR acquires tabular data summaries of satellite-derived surface reflectance
and surface temperature data at central locations within a lake. The sibling
product to this is [siteSR](https://github.com/AquaSat/AquaMatch_siteSR_WQP),
which acquires the same data at locations identified with monitoring records
from the Water Quality Portal from the
[AquaMatch](https://aquasat.github.io/AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP/) component of
AquaSat.

## Code Architecture

lakeSR is built on the {targets} workflow management system for R [@landau2021].
The {targets} architecture is based on lists of functions performed in a
specific order, each function called a *target*. The primary benefit of
{targets} workflows is that code is only run if a target, a target's code, or a
target's dependencies have changed (or become "outdated" in {targets} speak).

lakeSR is broken down into groups of targets that perform specific tasks, listed
below with a brief summary about what task(s) each group completes. This
particular workflow incorporates both R and Python programming languages to
complete these tasks.

**a_Calculate_Centers**:

This {targets} list calculates "Pole of Inaccessibility" (POI)
[@garcia-castellanos2007] for all non-intermittent lakes, ponds, and reservoirs
greater than 1 hectare in surface area and intermittent lakes, ponds, and
reservoirs greater than 4 hectares using the NHDPlusV2 polygons using the
{nhdplusTools} package [@blodgett2023] and the `poi()` function in the
{polylabelr} package [@larsson2020]. For all waterbodies outside of CONUS, POI
were calculated based on the NHD Best Resolution file for the entire state or
territory.

See Section \@ref(locs-data-acq) for additional background and detailed
methodology.

**b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi**:

This {targets} group uses the configuration file
`b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config_poi.yml` and the "Pole of
Inaccessibility" points created in the `a_Calculate_Centers` group to pull
Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature using the
Google Earth Engine (GEE) API. In this group, we use the most conservative LS4-7
pixel filters, as we are applying these settings across such a large continuum
of time and space. This group ends with a branched target that sends tasks to
Google Earth engine by mapping over WRS2 path rows that intersect with the
points created in the `a_Calculate_Centers` group. **Note**: this group of
targets takes a very, very long time, running 2 minutes - 1 hour per path-row
branch in `b_eeRun_poi`. There are just under 800 path rows executed in this
target. Anecdotally speaking, processing time is often defined by the number of
queued tasks globally, so weekends and nights are often periods of quicker
processing than weekday during business hours.

See Section \@ref(software-settings) for details on software used in this
workflow, Section \@ref(LS-C2-SRST) for additional background on Landsat data,
and Section \@ref(LS-SRST-pull) for detailed methodology of the Landsat pull.
