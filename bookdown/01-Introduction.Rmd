# Introduction

This bookdown document [@xie2016] explains the methodology we use in the
acquisition and compilation of satellite surface reflectance and surface
temperature data for all lakes in the United States and US Territories. This
product, "**lakeSR**", is a component of the **AquaSat** (v2) suite, an effort
to create a database of lake and river water quality observations alongside
remote sensing data.

Currently, **lakeSR** is comprised of the historical Landsat record from 1984
until mid-2023, comprised of data from the following missions:

-   Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM)
-   Landsat 5 TM
-   Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)
-   Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS)
-   Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS

Together the Landsat archive of **lakeSR** is referred to as
"*lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST*" (**L**and**s**at **C**ollection **2** **S**urface
**R**eflectance and **S**urface **T**emperature). There will be additional
satellite data incorporated into the **lakeSR** product in the future.

**lakeSR** acquires tabular data summaries of satellite-derived surface
reflectance and surface temperature data at central locations within a lake and
at locations identified with monitoring records from the Water Quality Portal
from the **AquaMatch** component of **AquaSat**.

## Code Architecture

**lakeSR** is built on the {targets} workflow management system for R
[@landau2021]. The {targets} architecture is based on lists of functions
performed in a specific order, each function called a *target*. The primary
benefit of {targets} workflows is that code is only run if a target, a target's
code, or a target's dependencies have changed (or become "outdated" in {targets}
speak).

**lakeSR** is broken down into functional groups of targets, listed below with a
brief summary about what task(s) each group completes.

**a_Calculate_Centers**:

This {targets} list calculates "Pole of Inaccessibility" (POI) for all lakes,
ponds, reservoirs, and playas greater than 1 hectare in surface area using the
NHDPlusHR polygons using the {nhdplusTools} package and the `poi()` function in
the {polylabelr} package. For all waterbodies in Alaska, POI were calculated
based on the NHD Best Resolution file for the entire state because the NHDPlusHR
is not complete for AK. **Note**: this group of targets will take up to 4h to
complete.

See Section \@ref(locations-of-data-acquisition) for additional background and
detailed methodology.

**b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi**:

This {targets} group uses the config file `config_files/config_poi.yml` and the
"Pole of Inaccessibility" points created in the `a_Calculate_Centers` group to
pull Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature using the
GEE API. In this group, we use the most strict LS4-7 pixel filters which include
the `sr_cloud_mask` filter. This filter is a conservative filter, removing
artefacts from upstream products that are used to create the SR product. This
group of targets ends with a branched target that maps over each of the WRS2
path rows that intersect with the points. **Note**: this group of targets takes
a very, very long time, averaging about 1 hour per path-row branch. There are
just under 800 path rows executed in this branch.

## Running the code within this repository

If you have followed all of the set up instructions, including those outlined in
Section \@ref(software-settings), the code within this repository can be
triggered by running the `run_targets.Rmd` file with the rProj file `lakeSR`
open in your RStudio console. If you do not wish to re-run the entirety of the
{targets} workflow, we encourage you to download the `lakeSR_targets.zip` file
**[[NOTE: will need to zip this later and/or add to the data release]]**, rename
it \_targets and copy it into the root directory of this repository, overwriting
the existing `_targets` folder and contents.
