# Introduction

This bookdown document [@xie2016] explains the methodology we use in the
acquisition and compilation of satellite surface reflectance and surface
temperature data for all lakes greater than 1 hectacre in the United States and
US Territories. This product, "**lakeSR**", is a component of the [**AquaSat**
suite](https://github.com/aquasat), an effort to create a database of lake and
river water quality observations alongside remote sensing data. This is an
update to the original **AquaSat** [@ross2019], the foundational effort towards
making satellite and *in situ* water quality data accessible for freshwater
monitoring.

Currently, **lakeSR** is comprised of the historical Landsat record from 1984
until late 2024, comprised of data from the following missions:

-   Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM)
-   Landsat 5 TM
-   Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)
-   Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS)
-   Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS

Together the Landsat archive of **lakeSR** is referred to as
"*lakeSR-LS_C2_SRST*" (**L**and**s**at **C**ollection **2** **S**urface
**R**eflectance and **S**urface **T**emperature). There will be additional
satellite data incorporated into the **lakeSR** product in the future.

**lakeSR** acquires tabular data summaries of satellite-derived surface
reflectance and surface temperature data at central locations within a lake. The
sibling product to this is **siteSR**, which acquires the same data at locations
identified with monitoring records from the Water Quality Portal from the
[**AquaMatch**](https://aquasat.github.io/AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP/) component of
**AquaSat**.

## Code Architecture

**lakeSR** is built on the {targets} workflow management system for R
[@landau2021]. The {targets} architecture is based on lists of functions
performed in a specific order, each function called a *target*. The primary
benefit of {targets} workflows is that code is only run if a target, a target's
code, or a target's dependencies have changed (or become "outdated" in {targets}
speak).

**lakeSR** is broken down into functional groups of targets, listed below with a
brief summary about what task(s) each group completes. This particular workflow
incorporates both R and Python programming languages to complete these tasks.

**a_Calculate_Centers**:

This {targets} list calculates "Pole of Inaccessibility" (POI,
[@garcia-castellanos2007]) for all non-intermittent lakes, ponds, and reservoirs
greater than 1 hectare in surface area and intermittent lakes, ponds, and
reservoirs greater than 4 hectares using the NHDPlusV2 polygons using the
{nhdplusTools} package [@blodgett2023] and the `poi()` function in the
{polylabelr} package [@larsson2020]. For all waterbodies outside of CONUS, POI
were calculated based on the NHD Best Resolution file for the entire state or
territory.

See Section \@ref(locs-data-acq) for additional background and detailed
methodology.

**b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi**:

This {targets} group uses the configuration file
`b_pull_Landsat_SRST_poi/config_files/config_poi.yml` and the "Pole of
Inaccessibility" points created in the `a_Calculate_Centers` group to pull
Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance and Surface Temperature using the GEE
API. In this group, we use the most conservative LS4-7 pixel filters, as we are
applying these settings across such a large continuum of time and space. This
group ends with a branched target that sends tasks to Google Earth engine by
mapping over WRS2 path rows that intersect with the points created in
`a_Calculate_Centers`. **Note**: this group of targets takes a very, very long
time, averaging about 1 hour per path-row branch. There are just under 800 path
rows executed in this branch.
