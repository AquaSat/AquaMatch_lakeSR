# Introduction

This {bookdown} [@xie2016] document explains the methodology we use in the acquisition and compilation of satellite surface reflectance and surface temperature data for the AquaSat v2 data suite. Specifically, this document describes data for all lakes greater than 1 hectare in the United States and US Territories ("lakeSR") and sites associated with Water Quality Portal ("WQP") data harmonized within the AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP data product ("siteSR_WQP"). We include the suffix "WQP" for siteSR to indicate the data originate from the WQP, allowing for future development of *in situ* data that may come from other sources. Generally speaking, siteSR refers to remote sensing data acquired at locations with *in situ* data and lakeSR refers to remote sensing data acquired at centrally-located points of waterbodies.

AquaSat v2 represents modular code and data infrastructure for:

1.  harmonizing *in situ* data from the Water Quality Portal and providing an interoperability tiering structure to allow for easier downstream filtering ("AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP")

2.  acquiring remote sensing data of inland waterbodies and rivers (lakeSR, siteSR, and riverSR)

3.  pairing *in situ* data and remote sensing data for parameter-specific algorithm development (e.g., AquaMatch_WQP_LandsatC2)

The goal of these data products is to facilitate assessment and monitoring of waterbodies within the United States and Territories using both *in situ* and remote sensing data.

AquaSat v2 builds upon AquaSat [@ross2019] (referred to here as "AquaSat v1") and LimnoSat-US [@limnosat]. AquaSat v1 focused on pairing remote sensing data with *in situ* observations and measurements while LimnoSat-US acquired remote sensing for all waterbodies greater than 10 hectares across the Continental United States (CONUS) regardless of whether *in situ* measurements were available for that waterbody. In AquaSat v2, we bring these products together. For instance, lakeSR can define Landsat intermission handoffs to enable use of Landsat as a timeseries product, siteSR products can be used to create parameter-specific algorithms, and those algorithms can be applied to lakeSR to create a timeseries of water quality for waterbodies in the US and territories.

AquaSat v2 code is built on the {targets} workflow management system for R [@landau2021]. The {targets} architecture is based on lists of functions performed in a specific order, each function called a *target*. The primary benefit of {targets} workflows is that code is only run if a target, a target's code, or a target's dependencies have changed (or become "outdated" in {targets} speak).
